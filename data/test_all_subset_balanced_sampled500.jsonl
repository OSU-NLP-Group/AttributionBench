A French invasion of the British-held island of Minorca led to the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756. Public disquiet over British failures at the start of the conflict led to Newcastle's resignation and the appointment of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, as prime minister and William Pitt the Elder as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. In April the following year George dismissed Pitt in an attempt to construct an administration more to his liking. Over the succeeding three months attempts to form another stable ministerial combination failed. In June Lord Waldegrave held the seals of office for only four days. By the start of July Pitt was recalled, and Newcastle returned as prime minister. As Secretary of State, Pitt guided policy relating to the war.

In addition, he posted a 453-minute scoreless streak, only 64 minutes short of compatriot Walter Zenga's all-time unbeaten record from the 1990 World Cup. The only goals he conceded were not in open play; an own goal by teammate Cristian Zaccardo after a free-kick against the United States in Italy's second match of the group stage, and a Zinedine Zidane penalty in the final against France. In the final, Buffon later made an important save in extra time on a header from eventual Golden Ball winner Zidane, which Buffon later described as the most important save of his career. The match ended 1\u20131 after extra time and was followed by a penalty shootout in which neither Buffon nor Fabien Barthez saved a spot kick. The lone miss was David Trezeguet's effort which hit the bottom of the crossbar and failed to cross the line, enabling Italy's Fabio Grosso to seal the victory for Italy. Buffon was named Man of the Match in Italy's 1\u20130 victory over Australia in the round of 16, and later also received the Yashin Award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, producing 40 saves, and was elected to the Team of the Tournament. Buffon also finished second to compatriot Fabio Cannavaro in the 2006 Ballon d'Or and eighth in the FIFA World Player of the Year for his performances that season, and was named in the 2006 FIFPro World XI and the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year. In 2013, Nick Miller of ESPN FC named Buffon's save against Lukas Podolski in Italy's 2\u20130 victory against hosts Germany in the semi-finals as one of the greatest in World Cup history, placing it at number nine in his list of \"World Cup's greatest ever saves\".

Sigma bonding is most simply defined for diatomic molecules using the language and tools of symmetry groups. In this formal approach, a \u03c3-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. By this definition, common forms of sigma bonds are s+s, p_z+p_z, s+p_z and d z^2+d z^2 (where z is defined as the axis of the bond or the internuclear axis).[2] Quantum theory also indicates that molecular orbitals (MO) of identical symmetry actually mix or hybridize. As a practical consequence of this mixing of diatomic molecules, the wavefunctions s+s and p_z+p_z molecular orbitals become blended.

These primitive organisms are thought to have originated from a process known as abiogenesis, where life is created from non-living organic matter. This could have occurred through a combination of energy, heat, and organic compounds that were present on Earth at the time. However, the exact process of how life formed still remains a mystery. Once these living organisms appeared, the process of evolution began. Genetic mutations gave rise to variations in traits and characteristics, which then led to natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which the most suitable traits and characteristics are passed down from one generation to the next, enabling species to survive and adapt to their environment. Over time, these changes accumulate and lead to the formation of new species. In conclusion, evolution is the process by which species change over time through genetic mutations and natural selection.

First, air filled tires provide better cushioning, allowing for a smoother ride. This reduces the amount of vibration and shock that would otherwise be experienced when driving, which helps to protect the car, its passengers, and other vehicles on the road. Furthermore, air filled tires offer better traction and provide better handling. The flexibility of the air filled tires allows them to adjust to the road surface, thereby improving grip and cornering performance. Another major benefit of using air filled tires is that they are much lighter than solid rubber tires. This is important not only because it increases fuel efficiency, but also because it reduces the overall weight of the vehicle, meaning that it accelerates faster, takes less time to stop, and is more maneuverable. Finally, air filled tires are much less prone to going flat. This is because the air provides an extra layer of protection, making it harder for sharp objects to puncture the tire wall. Even if a tire does go flat, it is much easier and less expensive to replace than a solid rubber tire.", "references": ["Title: Why Do We Fill Up Tires With Air? \u00bb Science ABC (www.scienceabc.com)\nText: When it comes to tire design, the most important factor is the ability of air to be compressed and adjust its volume with ease, unlike something made of a solid material. For example, when you are flying over the road at 60 mph, striking a small obstacle like a rock or a bump in the road is instantly absorbed by a tire filled with air (complemented by the shock absorbers installed in modern cars), whereas a solid rubber tire would absorb and pass along the shock of striking the obstacle, making for an extremely bumpy and uncomfortable ride. An air-filled tired can experience and adjust to multiple deformations per second, absorbing the shock, so drivers hardly feel the effects of striking a small obstacle, unlike these guys\u2026\n\nFurthermore, inflated rubber tires also offer a lower rolling resistance (i.e. such tires minimize wasted energy as a tire rolls, which, in turn, decreases the required rolling effort), which is another plus in favor of inflated rubber tires.", "Title: Why Do We Fill Up Tires With Air? \u00bb Science ABC (www.scienceabc.com)\nText: This is why rubber tires were able to be used in the past, before high speed automobiles were on the roads. Going slower meant that the impact of striking obstacles was less, and the energy loss was less noticeable. However, at high speeds, the amount of energy loss while passing over bumpy roads would be extremely inefficient for the car, and would cause tires to wear down much more quickly. The fact is, most people do not replace their tires as a result of punctures and flat tires, but rather because the tread wears down, thinning the rubber and making the tires unable to hold traction on the road.\n\nSolid rubber tires, particularly when driven at high speeds, would face the exact same problems of tread loss, at a faster rate, and due to the solid composition of the tires, would cost more to produce and dispose of, while also adding weight to the car as a whole, requiring more fuel expenditure.", "Title: everyday life - Why does a tire need to be filled with air? - Physics Stack Exchange (physics.stackexchange.com)\nText: You don't want to lose energy \u2013 not only because of energy efficiency but mainly because the desire to achieve high speeds and reduce the deterioration of the wheels \u2013 when the wheels are changing their shape due to the pressure caused by the weight of the vehicle.\n\n\nIf you want to squeeze the wheels with rubber by a centimeter, you need a substantially greater force if the tires are filled with air whose pressure is many atmospheres than if you have \"just the rubber\". So inflated wheels at 4 atmospheres guarantee that the wheels are more rigid and the ride is smoother.\n\n\nThis advantage becomes more important at higher speeds because the wheel could get deformed many times a second at higher speeds.

This is because the unique properties of french fries make them especially sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture. French fries are usually made from potatoes that have been cut into thin strips, deep-fried in oil, and seasoned with salt. When they are first cooked, the high temperature of the oil seals the outside of the fries and locks in the moisture inside. However, when they are reheated, the outside of the fries begins to dry out and the moisture inside escapes, leaving them dry and unpleasant to eat. In comparison, pizza is a dish that can be reheated relatively easily. This is because pizza is usually made with a doughy crust and a variety of toppings that are generally low in moisture. As the pizza is reheated, the dough begins to crisp and the toppings heat up, releasing their flavors. This creates a texture and flavor similar to when the pizza was freshly made. Additionally, the toppings also help to keep the crust from drying out, which helps to keep it from becoming too hard or crunchy.

{"question": "Why do we use air filled tires and not tires made of solid rubber, that don't run the risk of going flat?", "claim": "Even if a tire does go flat, it is much easier and less expensive to replace than a solid rubber tire.", "claim_raw_string": "Even if a tire does go flat, it is much easier and less expensive to replace than a solid rubber tire.", "response": " Using air filled tires instead of tires made of solid rubber has several advantages. First, air filled tires provide better cushioning, allowing for a smoother ride. This reduces the amount of vibration and shock that would otherwise be experienced when driving, which helps to protect the car, its passengers, and other vehicles on the road. Furthermore, air filled tires offer better traction and provide better handling. The flexibility of the air filled tires allows them to adjust to the road surface, thereby improving grip and cornering performance. Another major benefit of using air filled tires is that they are much lighter than solid rubber tires. This is important not only because it increases fuel efficiency, but also because it reduces the overall weight of the vehicle, meaning that it accelerates faster, takes less time to stop, and is more maneuverable. Finally, air filled tires are much less prone to going flat. This is because the air provides an extra layer of protection, making it harder for sharp objects to puncture the tire wall. Even if a tire does go flat, it is much easier and less expensive to replace than a solid rubber tire.", "references": ["Title: Why Do We Fill Up Tires With Air? \u00bb Science ABC (www.scienceabc.com)\nText: When it comes to tire design, the most important factor is the ability of air to be compressed and adjust its volume with ease, unlike something made of a solid material. For example, when you are flying over the road at 60 mph, striking a small obstacle like a rock or a bump in the road is instantly absorbed by a tire filled with air (complemented by the shock absorbers installed in modern cars), whereas a solid rubber tire would absorb and pass along the shock of striking the obstacle, making for an extremely bumpy and uncomfortable ride. An air-filled tired can experience and adjust to multiple deformations per second, absorbing the shock, so drivers hardly feel the effects of striking a small obstacle, unlike these guys\u2026\n\nFurthermore, inflated rubber tires also offer a lower rolling resistance (i.e. such tires minimize wasted energy as a tire rolls, which, in turn, decreases the required rolling effort), which is another plus in favor of inflated rubber tires.", "Title: Why Do We Fill Up Tires With Air? \u00bb Science ABC (www.scienceabc.com)\nText: This is why rubber tires were able to be used in the past, before high speed automobiles were on the roads. Going slower meant that the impact of striking obstacles was less, and the energy loss was less noticeable. However, at high speeds, the amount of energy loss while passing over bumpy roads would be extremely inefficient for the car, and would cause tires to wear down much more quickly. The fact is, most people do not replace their tires as a result of punctures and flat tires, but rather because the tread wears down, thinning the rubber and making the tires unable to hold traction on the road.\n\nSolid rubber tires, particularly when driven at high speeds, would face the exact same problems of tread loss, at a faster rate, and due to the solid composition of the tires, would cost more to produce and dispose of, while also adding weight to the car as a whole, requiring more fuel expenditure.", "Title: everyday life - Why does a tire need to be filled with air? - Physics Stack Exchange (physics.stackexchange.com)\nText: You don't want to lose energy \u2013 not only because of energy efficiency but mainly because the desire to achieve high speeds and reduce the deterioration of the wheels \u2013 when the wheels are changing their shape due to the pressure caused by the weight of the vehicle.\n\n\nIf you want to squeeze the wheels with rubber by a centimeter, you need a substantially greater force if the tires are filled with air whose pressure is many atmospheres than if you have \"just the rubber\". So inflated wheels at 4 atmospheres guarantee that the wheels are more rigid and the ride is smoother.\n\n\nThis advantage becomes more important at higher speeds because the wheel could get deformed many times a second at higher speeds. And it becomes more important for greater vehicles (relatively to toys) because their mass grows as $R^3$ with the radius $R$ while the area of the wheel is expected to grow as $R^2$ only.

First, it helps the pitcher get a better grip on the ball, allowing them to throw the ball with more spin and control. This can result in more movement on the pitch, making it more difficult for the hitter to make contact with the ball. Additionally, the substance can also reduce the amount of friction between the pitcher's hand and the ball, allowing them to throw the ball faster than they normally would. This can give the pitcher an advantage in terms of velocity, making it harder for the hitter to time the pitch. The risk of applying a foreign substance to a baseball is that it can be detected by the umpires and it can lead to a pitcher being ejected from the game. However, for a pitcher who is looking for an edge over their opponents, the risk is often worth the reward.

Once these living organisms appeared, the process of evolution began. Genetic mutations gave rise to variations in traits and characteristics, which then led to natural selection.

It is a slow and gradual process that can take thousands, millions, or even billions of years. As species evolve, they become better adapted to their environment, leading to the diversification of life on Earth. The first living organisms on Earth are believed to have emerged around 3.5 billion years ago in the form of single-celled organisms. These primitive organisms are thought to have originated from a process known as abiogenesis, where life is created from non-living organic matter. This could have occurred through a combination of energy, heat, and organic compounds that were present on Earth at the time. However, the exact process of how life formed still remains a mystery. Once these living organisms appeared, the process of evolution began. Genetic mutations gave rise to variations in traits and characteristics, which then led to natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which the most suitable traits and characteristics are passed down from one generation to the next, enabling species to survive and adapt to their environment. Over time, these changes accumulate and lead to the formation of new species. In conclusion, evolution is the process by which species change over time through genetic mutations and natural selection.

How will this decision affect the average person?", "claim": " According to some sources[6] [7], harmonizing tax rates in the EU could have different impacts depending on the type of tax and the method of harmonization.", "claim_raw_string": " According to some sources[6] [7], harmonizing tax rates in the EU could have different impacts depending on the type of tax and the method of harmonization.", "response": " I can try to answer your question based on the information I find online.\n\nAccording to some sources[6] [7], harmonizing tax rates in the EU could have different impacts depending on the type of tax and the method of harmonization.

Harmonizing **value-added tax (VAT) rates** could simplify cross-border trade and reduce compliance costs, but also affect consumer prices and welfare[1] [8].\n\n", "references": ["Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp\n\nThe need to change the structure of taxation systems in Europe has increased with the pressure on fiscal revenues facing the ageing of the population and excessive deficits. Moreover, as the number of the European Union Member States has grown, the differences in tax policies in the Union have became more significant. The fifth enlargement of the European Union has strengthened tax rates competition. Highly divergent direct tax rates across Europe have raised questions about the limits of national sovereignty over direct taxes and the need to harmonise corporate taxes. As a result of the transposition of the community acquis into the national legislation of each new Member State, and given that the Treaty establishing the European Community does not directly specify provisions on direct taxes, the immediate impact of the enlargement has been first felt in the area of indirect taxes.\n\nThe new wave of flat tax regimes, implemented by some of the new EU Member States , has intensified the necessity of corporate tax base harmonisation. First, decreasing direct tax rates have attracted more investors to these countries even if the tax regime is not the only factor for such a decision. After the German government\u2019s proposal to cut the corporate income tax rate from 25% to 19% , other countries think about restructuring their tax systems. In any case, the Member States\u2019 tax policies have to be compatible with the European tax legislation although the principle of subsidiarity authorises tax sovereignty of the Member States. The political and social preferences of each country require independence in creating national tax policy. However, the divergence in the tax systems of the EU Member States has created many obstacles and therefore incompatibility with the internal market. By eliminating these distortions the Community has achieved its aim of a single market. Today, companies operate throughout Europe thanks to the common rules established in the internal market, but at the same time more distortions have been created because of differences in Member States\u2019 interpretations of existing EU common tax rules and derogations accorded to some Member States.\n\nIn the past, VAT rates and excise duties have attained a high degree of harmonisation, some areas of taxation have been coordinated and some laws have been approximated. There has never been an attempt to harmonise personal income taxes on a European level. However, the European Commission has emphasized that the coordination in the area of personal income taxes is needed to prevent double taxation of cross-border workers and other obstacles, harmful to the internal market. The Commission and the European Court of Justice share the same opinion saying that personal income taxes do not need to be harmonised. In fact, the internal market would not be disturbed without harmonisation of personal income taxes in the Union.\n\nEven if direct taxation is not specified by the Treaty establishing the European Community (The EC Treaty), as the article 93 of the EC Treaty specifies the adoption of measures for indirect taxation, important Council Directives have been adopted in this particular area . Moreover, the European Court of Justice\u2019s pending cases concerning direct taxation have had an influence on Member States\u2019 national legislation. Furthermore, the articles 94 and 95 of the EC Treaty which do not specify the area of taxation have allowed their application to both, direct and indirect taxes.\n\nThe lack of primary law in the area of corporate taxation has been completed by directives, regulations, decisions and direct tax case law. Most provisions have aimed at coordinating the tax systems of the EU Member States although the Commission\u2019s increasing initiative in this field expected some degree of harmonisation. The most significant are the Mergers Directive and the Parent-Subsidiary Directive adopted in 1990, the 2004 Directive on interest and royalty payments between EU companies, and the 2005 Directive applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchange of shares.\n\nA common consolidated corporate tax base\n\nThe idea of a common tax base for the EU companies was accepted neither by all Member States nor by the whole business area . First, the unanimity vote of the Council of Ministers could be an obstacle, but would possibly be resolved by closer cooperation of Member States in form of enhanced cooperation. Second, complicated technical implementation of the Common Consolidated Tax Base (CCTB) made the Member States\u2019 governments more reluctant. Moreover, some Member States fear that a common corporate tax base could imply harmonisation of tax rates.\n\nThe proposal of a CCTB consists in existing national corporate tax systems plus a new one which would represent a new harmonised EU rule for the definition of a common tax base on a European level. Such a European system would not therefore require a harmonisation of the existing 25 taxation rules and its application would be optional . A common tax base for the EU-wide companies\u2019 functioning would be then allocated to the Member States via this rule. In this case national systems won\u2019t be replaced, however, the most complete and transparent option would be to harmonise national rules and replace them with a single EU company taxation system .\n\nNevertheless in the Communication COM (2003) 726 the European Commission proposed solutions allowing companies to use a single tax base. Since January 2005, the EU companies have implemented the International Accounting Standards IAS (under the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS ), which would permit linking the tax base to these standards. The IAS/IFRS would stay a neutral, common starting point for further discussions but nothing more .\n\nAlready in 2001, the Commission, in the Communication COM (2001) 582, presented its view on a common consolidated corporate tax base CCTB, considering that it is the only way of eliminating obstacles from the cross-border activities of the EU companies. Moreover, some tax obstacles were identified. The priority was given to the problem of high compliance costs and the problems with cross-border loss-offset which are due to the divergence of corporate tax systems between the Member States. Given that these problems are more significant in the small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 activities, the Commission has developed the project of the \u201chome state taxation of the SMEs\u201d based on a survey of the EU companies. The tax base would be calculated in accordance with the tax code of the company\u2019s home state .\n\nProvided that there is enough political will, the pilot strategy of home state taxation for small and medium sized enterprises is likely to be launched in 2005 as a five years programme. Even if some countries oppose the project of a common corporate tax base, the concept is well established as a long term goal for EU tax policy and the accounting consolidation method would be a suitable beginning for a common company tax base. On the contrary, a jurisdiction or a legal system that would resolve conflicts between Member States on the application of such new rules has not been mentioned.\n\nApart from the proposed changes in the EU company taxation, companies and co-operatives have the right to establish themselves as single entities under Community law. According to the Council Regulation EC 2157/2001 and the Council Directive 2001/89/EC the European Company can be created since 2004 and the European Co-operative Society from 2006 . On the contrary, the Commission\u2019s idea of creating a common tax base with the European Company was accepted but would only be put into practice under the condition of operational EU tax rules .\n\nIn case of reluctance of some Member States, the Union has still the possibility to get adopted measures on taxation, like the one on a CCTB via enhanced cooperation as a last resort solution, or using other legislative options that have increased its competence. Nevertheless, Member States control the EU tax legislation because the Treaty requires unanimity vote (articles 93, 94 EC Treaty) and because the principle of subsidiarity allows Member States keeping taxation under national legislation.\n\nEnhanced cooperation and tax policy\n\nMeeting political decisions on tax policy in Europe was difficult because of the required unanimous decision of the Council of Ministers. Today, if some European countries oppose steps towards a European integration, a minimum of eight EU Member States will be allowed to act via enhanced cooperation. This could be the case of the establishment of a common consolidated tax base for companies. On the one side, some Member States willing to further tax policy have the possibility to agree on this issue by enhanced cooperation, provided that there are no other possibilities mentioned by treaties and that Member States follow the objectives of the Union. On the other side, the enhanced cooperation reinforces the subsidiarity principle because it represents the Member States\u2019 initiative and moreover helps to avoid the problem of unanimity vote in the field of taxation.\n\nThe Nice Treaty has established many changes by amending general provisions on closer cooperation between Member States. The articles 43-45 of the Treaty on European Union (the EU Treaty) apply to enhanced cooperation in the area covered by the EC Treaty. The Article 43 of the EU Treaty was therefore amended by the Treaty of Nice . Additionally, the article 11 of the EC Treaty was amended too, so that the procedure of establishing the enhanced cooperation was changed . Moreover, the principle of last resort mentioned in the Article 43a and amended by the Treaty of Nice says that such cooperation could only be established if relevant objectives can\u2019t be achieved by applying treaties. According to the amended article 43b, the principle of openness encourages those who want to participate and is opened to all Member States to participate on enhanced cooperation when it is established and at any time after its establishment.\n\nThe Treaty of Nice facilitated the enhanced cooperation between the EU Member States. The right of veto over the establishment of enhanced cooperation, that the Member States enjoyed until the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice was abolished, except in the area of foreign policy.\n\nFurthermore, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provides even bigger possibility for enhanced cooperation and therefore allows moving further in the area of tax policy. In the context of enhanced cooperation, the article III-422 of the Constitution authorises the Council to adopt (acting unanimously in accordance with the Article I-44 \u2013 general procedure of establishment of enhanced cooperation) a European decision stipulating that it will act by a qualified majority. As a result, the Council shall decide on qualified majority even if, in principle, the unanimity is required . The Constitution changes the minimum of participating states from current eight to one third of the EU Member States.\n\nFollowing the article 95 of the EC Treaty in order to take some decisions on taxation has given the Union the possibility to adopt measures on qualified majority. In this article the role of the European Parliament in the legislative procedure is as important as the Council\u2019s role because of the co-decision procedure. On the contrary, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe has even restricted the role of the EP because the article III-172 of the Constitution, the successor to the article 95 EC Treaty, doesn\u2019t involve the European Parliament.\n\nThe EU competence on tax matters\n\nEven though the Article 95 (2) of the EC Treaty excludes fiscal provisions, some tax measures of administrative nature have been adopted using this article . The article authorises the Council to adopt measures for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in a Member State which aim to a better functioning of the internal market. But, this only applies in accordance with the Article 14 and the Article 251 of the EC Treaty .\n\nAs stated by a study , some taxation measures have been adopted by co-decision procedure, none of them on direct taxation. Many Council directives have been adopted after consulting the EP not following the co-decision procedure, meaning that mainly the articles 93 et 94 EC Treaty were used, and as these do not require the Parliament\u2019s decision, they get adopted easily and their adoption took less time.\n\nBut in fact, the article 94 (which does not specify direct or indirect taxation) and the article 93 (on indirect taxes, excise duties, turnover taxes) have allowed adopting the provisions on which the EU Member States were able to agree , thus mainly on indirect taxation. That could be the reason why many Commission proposals on direct taxation were rejected. There were 33 withdrawals of Commission proposals for a Council Directive out of 42 and only one withdrawal of Commission proposal for an EP and Council Directive .\n\nFurthermore, the Commission has exclusive power under the Treaty to take decisions on whether aid granted by Member States is compatible with the article 87 of the EC Treaty. According to the article 87 EC Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or granted through state resources, for example a tax relief, which distorts or threatens to distort competition, is incompatible with Community law, because it affects the trade between Member States and therefore affects the functioning of the internal market. However, some State aids could be considered compatible in situations which are described by the paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Article 87 .\n\nUnder article 226 EC Treaty, the Commission can initiate an infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice in case of violation of Community law by a Member State.\n\nApart from enhanced cooperation, where the Constitution\u2019s provisions are similar to those specified in the amended articles of the EU Treaty, the Council of Ministers shall decide on fiscal provisions through the flexibility clause. If such action is necessary to achieve one of the objectives defined in the Constitution, and the Constitution has not implemented the necessary power, the Council shall adopt the appropriate measures, acting unanimously on a proposal from the European Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. The flexibility clause of article I-18 of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe allows the Union to use more power than conferred on it.\n\nHowever, the article I-18 excludes harmonisation of Member States\u2019 laws or regulations in cases where the Constitution does not authorise such measures. Given that, the article III-171 of the Constitution authorises the Council to adopt harmonisation measures on indirect taxation, the flexibility clause applies also to fiscal provisions. As a consequence, the flexibility clause has widened the application of provisions of the article 308 of the EC Treaty and its use was expanded to other areas beyond the current Single Market.\n\nIn addition, the article IV-444 (2) of the Constitution covers the same area as the flexibility clause in order to adopt a European decision (for example on fiscal provisions) which would allow the Council to act on qualified majority instead of unanimity. If national parliaments do not oppose the decision of the European Council within six months from the notification of such a rule, the European decision allowing acting on qualified majority shall be adopted.\n\nThe flexibility clause as mentioned in the article I-18 of the Constitution would empower the Union to act in some areas, including the fiscal area. According to the article I-18 (2), the Commission must inform national parliaments of proposals based on the flexibility clause, using the procedure for monitoring the subsidiarity principle. But as long as the unanimity is needed, the Council of Ministers shall adopt measures only on that condition.\n\nThe EU primary tax law and tax harmonisation\n\nThe EC Treaty articles constitute the primary law in the area of taxation and are, except for the article 95 of the EC Treaty, subject to the unanimity of the Council and to the subsidiarity principle.\n\nThe article 90 EC Treaty prohibits any Member State to impose directly or indirectly excessive taxation, or internal taxation to the products of other Member State, and/or any internal taxation that would form an indirect protection to other products. The article 90 EC Treaty therefore forbids tax discrimination that gives a Member State advantage to its domestic products. In case of non respect by a Member State, the matter may be subject to infringement procedure before the Court of Justice. The following articles, 91-93 EC Treaty abolish export subsidies in form of repayment of internal taxation.\n\nAccording to the article 93 EC Treaty, the Council shall, acting unanimously on a proposal of the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation, to the extent that such harmonization is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market.\n\nThe article 94 EC Treaty authorises the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, to issue directives for the approximation of such laws, regulations or administrative provisions of Member States as directly affect the establishment or functioning of the common market.\n\nThe article 94 allows the Council to take measures on tax rules approximation without emphasizing that such a measure has to be focused on indirect taxation. As a consequence, the article 94 EC Treaty neither excludes issuing directives on the matter of direct taxation, nor does the article 94 encourage harmonisation. In any way, every directive must be compatible with the rules of the internal market and has to respect the fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty. Moreover, the article 94 emphasizes that the establishment or functioning of the common market is a stricter condition for the Council\u2019s intervention than it is in the article 93.\n\nFirst, the article 93 authorises the Council to adopt provisions concerning indirect taxes, particularly to adopt provisions on the harmonisation of legislation on turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation. Secondly, the article 94 which authorises the Council to issue directives for the approximation of laws etc., confirms that neither harmonisation of direct taxes nor provisions on direct taxation are included in the primary legal basis. However, an approximation of direct tax systems is possible due to the article 94, which has been used to adopt measures on direct taxation.\n\nCompared to the article 93 of the EC Treaty, the Constitution in the article III-171 adds the avoidance of distortion of competition as the extra condition for adopting a harmonisation measure. The Council shall still act on unanimity (after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee), but according to the article III-171, without a proposal from the Commission.\n\nFurthermore, the article 308 of the EC Treaty gives the Council the right to act unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, if such an action is necessary to achieve the Community objective related to the functioning of the internal market. So the Council shall adopt measures (including a harmonisation measure) on direct taxation under specific conditions, not only directives for the approximation of tax laws as mentioned in the Article 94 .\n\nGiven that the articles 93 and 94 EC Treaty serve as primary law in the tax field and that the legislative procedure does not require the co-decision of the European Parliament, the EP is less involved in the adoption of tax provisions. However, the EP could set up committees of inquiry, send questions on Commission proposals or appoint the Commission.\n\nAs long as the Treaty does not specify provisions on direct taxation, some measures can be adopted under article 95 EC Treaty given that such laws have as object the establishment and the functioning of the internal market and that they have been approved by both, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.\n\nIn the EU tax policy, the subsidiarity principle which allows Member States keeping the taxation under their national legislation reinforces the fact that direct taxation should, in principle, stay under national law. In fact, Member States intend to harmonise areas in which distortions of competition can be influenced by their national means , especially in the field of indirect taxation. Consequently, many provisions adopted in the past were especially Council directives on the VAT, while many Commission proposals on direct taxation have been withdrawn because the Commission wasn\u2019t successful to get it adopted.\n\nThe subsidiarity principle\n\nAccording to the subsidiarity principle, the EU Member States have independence in creating policy and legislation, which is advantageous to the new policy developments, while finding a European solution would be very long. Moreover, the tax sovereignty gives countries direct control over the tax rules and the tax revenues. Although the reform of corporate tax systems in the European Union is necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the internal market, harmonisation of direct taxes would be incompatible with the subsidiarity principle. Moreover, harmonisation of direct taxes (for example corporate tax rates) would have a negative impact on business activities, especially on the small and medium-sized enterprises. For many countries the competitive tax policy is a comparative advantage. A competitive European tax policy is beneficial to the SMEs which are considered as the biggest growth and employment creators .\n\nSince the creation of the Single Market, many distortions in the tax field have been resolved by a coordinated action at EU level. In such cases the tax sovereignty has been limited. These situations have been mainly related to cross-border problems, actions that cause obstacles to the internal market, or to tax fraud and tax avoidance. Considering that convergence of national tax legislation in the area of indirect taxes has already increased the effectiveness of the internal market, there would be no reason to harmonise direct tax legislation unless national tax policies are incompatible with the EU tax legislation. Even if there is an impact of the incompatibility of national laws with the Treaty on the four freedoms or on the right of establishment for individuals and for companies, these particular cases are subject to procedures of the European Court of Justice and thus serve as case law. Generally, there would not be a need of primary direct tax law.\n\nTo summarise the EU initiatives on tax harmonisation, only the VAT rates and the excise duties have achieved a high degree of harmonisation with the establishment of the Single Market and the abolition of intra-Community tax controls. Apart from the VAT and the excise duties, the indirect taxes may be harmonised following the article 93 EC Treaty and therefore help preventing double taxation, tax avoidance and disturbing of tax competition.\n\nTax coordination under the principle of subsidiarity refers to the compatibility of national legislation with treaties. At least a sufficient level of coordination is needed in the area of company taxation; however, the Commission proposed a common tax base for European companies without fixed rates, aimed in the long term at a harmonised European corporate tax base. The Commission proposal of the Home State Taxation scheme would be based on mutual recognition of the Member States\u2019 tax rules and tax coordination. European coordination may help to avoid tax revenue losses as the capital is mobile across EU countries.\n\nHowever, the personal income tax and the tax on dividends of individuals should stay under each Member State\u2019s national rules. According to the Court of Justice, in the absence of the EU harmonisation, the personal income taxation shall be safeguarded as each Member State\u2019s national policy. Moreover, there must not be unjustified restrictions to the free movement of services, workers, capital and the freedom of the establishment as defined in the articles 39, 43, 49 and 56 of the EC Treaty, or any direct or indirect discrimination based on nationality. In addition, general and final provisions of the EC Treaty abolish under article 293, double taxation within the Community and encourage the respect of the rights of individuals in cross-border situations.\n\nRegarding the approximation of national tax legislation, the Code of Conduct for business taxation of 1997 has aimed apart from eliminating distortions in the Single Market, the abolition of harmful tax measures. It also included a proposal on savings taxation, and a proposal of a directive which would eliminate withholding tax on payments of interest and royalties between associated companies. In 2004, a proposal for a Code of Conduct was established in order to eliminate double taxation on profits from cross-border transfer pricing.\n\nThe tax systems of the Member States have been restructured to the extent of achieving some approximation via cooperation. In fact, as direct taxation is not directly specified by the Treaty, its harmonisation would be incompatible with Community law, but its coordination will be legally acceptable. In case of the proposal of home state taxation for SMEs, a tax rules harmonisation is not intended. On the contrary, a common tax base for companies would be a step forward to a European integration based on a harmonised rule. In any way, in the context of tax competition, the maintaining of 25 different corporate tax regimes within Europe will be in the long term difficult.\n\nAnother way for the Union to intervene in Member States\u2019 tax policies is through the European Court of Justice\u2019s cases. Even though Member States benefit from national sovereignty under the subsidiarity principle, they are required to apply treaties as well as the interpretation of ECJ cases.\n\nThe EU direct tax case law and the role of the European Court of Justice\n\nAn increasing number of corporate tax cases referred to the Court of Justice have strengthened the role of the ECJ in the field of direct taxation, mainly by the ECJ decisions in pending cases. Consequently, the ECJ jurisprudence has had significant influence on the application of the Treaty by all Member States because its decisions have implications for most of the EU Member States not only those involved in a case. However, some legal tax matters subject to the ECJ have authorised the application of domestic taxation rules and thus confirmed that not every measure that favours another Member State is an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. In any case, the European Court of Justice has to deal mostly with the reluctance of some Member States to make their tax systems compatible wit"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_6fc63e8f-3b79-4aeb-9bcc-15bec430c419"}

This circulation brings warmth to various parts of the globe and also carries nutrients necessary to sustain ocean life.\n\nThe circulation process begins as warm water near the surface moves toward the poles (such as the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic), where it cools and forms sea ice. As this ice forms, salt is left behind in the ocean water. Due to the large amount of salt in the water, it becomes denser, sinks down, and is carried southwards in the depths below. Eventually, the water gets pulled back up towards the surface and warms up in a process called upwelling, completing the cycle.\n\nThe entire circulation cycle of the AMOC, and the global conveyor belt, is quite slow. It takes an estimated 1,000 years for a parcel (any given cubic meter) of water to complete its journey along the belt. Even though the whole process is slow on its own, there is some evidence that the AMOC is slowing down further. NOAA funds research to better understand this potential slowing, as well as to investigate the AMOC\u2019s role in coastal sea level changes and its relationship to extreme events.\n\nIs the AMOC slowing down?\n\nAs our climate continues to change, is there a possibility that the AMOC will slow down, or come to a complete stop? While research shows it is weakening over the past century, whether or not it will continue to slow or stop circulating completely remains uncertain. If the AMOC does continue to slow down, however, it could have far-reaching climate impacts. For example, if the planet continues to warm, freshwater from melting ice at the poles would shift the rain belt in South Africa, causing droughts for millions of people. It would also cause sea level rise across the U.S. East Coast.", "System of surface and deep currents in the Atlantic Ocean\n\n\"AMOC\" redirects here. For other uses, see AMOC (disambiguation)\n\nTopographic map of the Nordic Seas and subpolar basins with surface currents (solid curves) and deep currents (dashed curves) that form a portion of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Colors of curves indicate approximate temperatures.\n\nThe Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is part of a global thermohaline circulation in the oceans and is the zonally integrated component of surface and deep currents in the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by a northward flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic, and a southward flow of colder, deep waters. These \"limbs\" are linked by regions of overturning in the Nordic and Labrador Seas and the Southern Ocean, although the extent of overturning in the Labrador Sea is disputed.[1][2] The AMOC is an important component of the Earth's climate system, and is a result of both atmospheric and thermohaline drivers.\n\nClimate change has the potential to weaken the AMOC through increases in ocean heat content and elevated freshwater flows from the melting ice sheets. Oceanographic reconstructions generally suggest that the AMOC is already weaker than it was before the Industrial Revolution,[3][4] although there is a robust debate over the role of climate change versus the circulation's century-scale and millennial-scale variability.[5][6] Climate models consistently project that the AMOC would weaken further over the 21st century,[7]: 19 which would affect average temperature over areas like Scandinavia and Britain that are warmed by the North Atlantic drift,[8] as well as accelerate sea level rise around North America and reduce primary production in the North Atlantic.[9]\n\nSevere weakening of the AMOC has the potential to cause an outright collapse of the circulation, which would not be easily reversible and thus constitute one of the tipping points in the climate system.[10] A shutdown would have far greater impacts than a slowdown on both the marine and some terrestrial ecosystems: it would lower the average temperature and precipitation in Europe, slashing the region's agricultural output,[11] and may have a substantial effect on extreme weather events.[12] Earth system models used in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project indicate that shutdown is only likely after high levels of warming are sustained well after 2100,[13][14][15] but they have been criticized by some researchers for what they saw as excessive stability,[16] and a number of lower-complexity studies argue that a collapse can happen considerably earlier.[17][18] One of those lower-complexity projections suggests that AMOC collapse could happen around 2057,[19] but many scientists are skeptical of the claim.[20] On the other hand, paleoceanographic research suggests that the AMOC may be even more stable than what is predicted by most models.[21][22]\n\nOverall structure [ edit ]\n\nAMOC in relation to the global thermohaline circulation (animation)\n\nThe Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is part of a global thermohaline circulation in the oceans and is the zonally integrated component of surface and deep currents in the Atlantic Ocean. The general thermohaline circulation is a pattern of water flow through the world's oceans. Warm water flows along the surface until it reaches one of a few special spots near Greenland or Antarctica. There, the water sinks, and then crawls across the bottom of the ocean, miles/kilometers deep, over hundreds of years, gradually rising in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Northward surface flow transports a substantial amount of heat energy from the tropics and Southern Hemisphere toward the North Atlantic, where the heat is lost to the atmosphere due to the strong temperature gradient. Upon losing its heat, the water becomes denser and sinks. This densification links the warm, surface limb with the cold, deep return limb at regions of convection in the Nordic and Labrador Seas. The limbs are also linked in regions of upwelling, where a divergence of surface waters causes Ekman suction and an upward flux of deep water.[citation needed]\n\nAMOC consists of upper and lower cells. The upper cell consists of northward surface flow as well as southward return flow of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The lower cell represents northward flow of dense Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) \u2013 this bathes the abyssal ocean.[1]\n\nAMOC exerts a major control on North Atlantic sea level, particularly along the Northeast Coast of North America. Exceptional AMOC weakening during the winter of 2009\u201310 has been implicated in a damaging 13 cm sea level rise along the New York coastline.[23]\n\nThere may be two stable states of the AMOC: a strong circulation (as seen over recent millennia) and a weak circulation mode, as suggested by atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models and Earth systems models of intermediate complexity.[18] A number of Earth system models do not identify this bistability, however.[18]\n\nEffects on climate [ edit ]\n\nThe net northward heat transport in the Atlantic is unique among global oceans, and is responsible for the relative warmth of the Northern Hemisphere.[1] AMOC carries up to 25% of the northward global atmosphere-ocean heat transport in the northern hemisphere.[24] This is generally thought to ameliorate the climate of Northwest Europe, although this effect is the subject of debate.[25][26][27]\n\nAs well as acting as a heat pump and high-latitude heat sink,[28][29] AMOC is the largest carbon sink in the Northern Hemisphere, sequestering approximately 0.7 Pg (0.7 Gt) C/year.[30] This sequestration has significant implications for evolution of anthropogenic global warming \u2013 especially with respect to the recent and projected future decline in AMOC vigor.[31]\n\nThermohaline circulation and fresh water [ edit ]\n\nThe red end of the spectrum indicates slowing in this presentation of the trend of velocities derived from NASA Pathfinder altimeter data from May 1992 to June 2002. Source: NASA.\n\nHeat is transported from the equator polewards mostly by the atmosphere but also by ocean currents, with warm water near the surface and cold water at deeper levels. The best known segment of this circulation is the Gulf Stream, a wind-driven gyre, which transports warm water from the Caribbean northwards. A northwards branch of the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Drift, is part of the thermohaline circulation (THC), transporting warmth further north to the North Atlantic, where its effect in warming the atmosphere contributes to warming Europe.[citation needed]\n\nThe evaporation of ocean water in the North Atlantic increases the salinity of the water as well as cooling it, both actions increasing the density of water at the surface. Formation of sea ice further increases the salinity and density, because salt is ejected into the ocean when sea ice forms.[32] This dense water then sinks and the circulation stream continues in a southerly direction. However, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is driven by ocean temperature and salinity differences. But freshwater decreases ocean water salinity, and through this process prevents colder waters sinking. This mechanism possibly caused the cold ocean surface temperature anomaly currently observed near Greenland (Cold blob (North Atlantic)).[33]\n\nGlobal warming could lead to an increase in freshwater in the northern oceans, by melting glaciers in Greenland, and by increasing precipitation, especially through Siberian rivers.[34][35]\n\nStudies of the Florida Current suggest that the Gulf Stream weakens with cooling, being weakest (by ~10%) during the Little Ice Age.[36]\n\nRegions of overturning [ edit ]\n\nConvection and return flow in the Nordic Seas [ edit ]\n\nLow air temperatures at high latitudes cause substantial sea-air heat flux, driving a density increase and convection in the water column. Open ocean convection occurs in deep plumes and is particularly strong in winter when the sea-air temperature difference is largest.[37] Of the 6 sverdrup (Sv) of dense water that flows southward over the GSR (Greenland-Scotland Ridge), 3 Sv does so via the Denmark Strait forming Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW). 0.5-1 Sv flows over the Iceland-Faroe ridge and the remaining 2\u20132.5 Sv returns through the Faroe-Shetland Channel; these two flows form Iceland Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW). The majority of flow over the Faroe-Shetland ridge flows through the Faroe-Bank Channel and soon joins that which flowed over the Iceland-Faroe ridge, to flow southward at depth along the Eastern flank of the Reykjanes Ridge. As ISOW overflows the GSR (Greenland-Scotland Ridge), it turbulently entrains intermediate density waters such as Sub-Polar Mode water and Labrador Sea Water. This grouping of water-masses then moves geostrophically southward along the East flank of Reykjanes Ridge, through the Charlie Gibbs Fracture Zone and then northward to join DSOW. These waters are sometimes referred to as Nordic Seas Overflow Water (NSOW). NSOW flows cyclonically following the surface route of the SPG (sub-polar gyre) around the Labrador Sea and further entrains Labrador Sea Water (LSW).[38]\n\nConvection is known to be suppressed at these high latitudes by sea-ice cover. Floating sea ice \"caps\" the surface, reducing the ability for heat to move from the sea to the air. This in turn reduces convection and deep return flow from the region. The summer Arctic sea ice cover has undergone dramatic retreat since satellite records began in 1979, amounting to a loss of almost 30% of the September ice cover in 39 years.[39][40] Climate model simulations suggest that rapid and sustained September Arctic ice loss is likely in future 21st century climate projections.[41][42][43][44]\n\nConvection and entrainment in the Labrador Sea [ edit ]\n\nCharacteristically fresh LSW is formed at intermediate depths by deep convection in the central Labrador Sea, particularly during winter storms.[37] This convection is not deep enough to penetrate into the NSOW layer which forms the deep waters of the Labrador Sea. LSW joins NSOW to move southward out of the Labrador Sea: while NSOW easily passes under the NAC at the North-West Corner, some LSW is retained. This diversion and retention by the SPG explains its presence and entrainment near the GSR (Greenland-Scotland Ridge) overflows. Most of the diverted LSW however splits off before the CGFZ (Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone) and remains in the western SPG. LSW production is highly dependent on sea-air heat flux and yearly production typically ranges from 3\u20139 Sv.[45][46] ISOW is produced in proportion to the density gradient across the Iceland-Scotland Ridge and as such is sensitive to LSW production which affects the downstream density[47][48] More indirectly, increased LSW production is associated with a strengthened SPG and hypothesized to be anti-correlated with ISOW[49][50][51] This interplay confounds any simple extension of a reduction in individual overflow waters to a reduction in AMOC. LSW production is understood to have been minimal prior to the 8.2 ka event,[52] with the SPG thought to have existed before in a weakened, non-convective state.[53] There is debate about the extent to which convection in the Labrador Sea plays a role in AMOC circulation, particularly in the connection between Labrador sea variability and AMOC variability.[54] Observational studies have been inconclusive about whether this connection exists.[1] New observations with the OSNAP array show little contribution from the Labrador Sea to overturning, and hydrographic observations from ships dating back to 1990 show similar results.[2][55] Nevertheless, older estimates of LSW formation using different techniques suggest larger overturning.[56]\n\nAtlantic upwelling [ edit ]\n\nFor reasons of conservation of mass, the global ocean system must upwell an equal volume of water to that downwelled. Upwelling in the Atlantic itself occurs mostly due to coastal and equatorial upwelling mechanisms.\n\nCoastal upwelling occurs as a result of Ekman transport along the interface between land and a wind-driven current. In the Atlantic, this particularly occurs around the Canary Current and Benguela Current. Upwelling in these two regions has been modelled to be in antiphase, an effect known as \"upwelling see-saw\".[57]\n\nEquatorial upwelling generally occurs due to atmospheric forcing and divergence due to the opposing direction of the Coriolis force either side of the equator. The Atlantic features more complex mechanisms such as migration of the thermocline, particularly in the Eastern Atlantic.[58]\n\nSouthern Ocean upwelling [ edit ]\n\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water is primarily upwelled at the southern end of the Atlantic transect, in the Southern Ocean.[29] This upwelling comprises the majority of upwelling normally associated with AMOC, and links it with the global circulation.[1] On a global scale, observations suggest 80% of deepwater upwells in the Southern Ocean.[59]\n\nThis upwelling supplies large quantities of nutrients to the surface, which supports biological activity. Surface supply of nutrients is critical to the ocean's functioning as a carbon sink on long timescales. Furthermore, upwelled water has low concentrations of dissolved carbon, as the water is typically 1000 years old and has not been sensitive to anthropogenic CO 2 increases in the atmosphere.[60] Because of its low carbon concentration, this upwelling functions as a carbon sink. Variability in the carbon sink over the observational period has been closely studied and debated.[61] The size of the sink is understood to have decreased until 2002, and then increased until 2012.[62]\n\nAfter upwelling, the water is understood to take one of two pathways: water surfacing near to sea-ice generally forms dense bottomwater and is committed to AMOC's lower cell; water surfacing at lower latitudes moves further northward due to Ekman transport and is committed to the upper cell.[29][63]\n\nTrends [ edit ]\n\nReconstructions [ edit ]\n\nClimate reconstructions generally support the hypothesis that the AMOC is already weaker now than it was in the early 20th century. For instance, a 2010 statistical analysis found an ongoing weakening of the AMOC since the late 1930s, with an abrupt shift of a North Atlantic overturning cell around 1970.[64] Climate scientists Michael Mann of Penn State and Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research suggested that the observed cold pattern during years of temperature records is a sign that the Atlantic Ocean's Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may be weakening. They published their findings in 2015, and concluded that the AMOC circulation was slowing throughout the 20th century, and that the weakness it demonstrated after 1975 was unprecedented over the last millennium. They suggested that even though the AMOC had experienced partial recovery after 1975, future Greenland ice sheet melt would be likely to weaken it further still.[3] Another 2015 study suggested that the AMOC has weakened by 15\u201320% in 200 years.[65] In 2018, another reconstruction suggested a weakening of around 15% since the mid-twentieth century.[66] However, all these findings were challenged by 2022 research which indicated that between 1900 and 2019, a climate change-induced trend did not begin to emerge until 1980, and it is still faint relative to the circulation's natural variability.[5]\n\nSome studies attempt to go deeper into the preindustrial past. In 2018, one such paper suggested that the last 150 years of AMOC showed exceptional weakness when compared to the previous 1500 years, and it indicated a discrepancy in the modeled timing of AMOC decline after the Little Ice Age.[67] In February 2021, a study published in Nature Geoscience[4] reported that the preceding millennium had seen an unprecedented weakening of the AMOC, an indication that the change was caused by human actions.[68] Its co-author said that AMOC had already slowed by about 15%, with impacts now being seen: \"In 20 to 30 years it is likely to weaken further, and that will inevitably influence our weather, so we would see an increase in storms and heatwaves in Europe, and sea level rises on the east coast of the US.\"[68] In February 2022, Nature Geoscience published a \"Matters Arising\" commentary article co-authored by 17 scientists, which disputed those findings and argued that the long-term AMOC trend remains uncertain.[6] The journal had also published a response from the authors of 2021 study to \"Matters Arising\" article, where they defended their findings.[69]\n\nIn February 2021, a study had reconstructed the past 30 years of AMOC variability and found no evidence of decline.[70] In August 2021, a study published in Nature Climate Change showed significant changes in eight independent AMOC indices, and suggested that they could indicate \"an almost complete loss of stability\". However, while it drew on over a century of ocean temperature and salinity data, it was forced to omit all data from 35 years before 1900 and after 1980 to maintain consistent records of all eight indicators.[18] In April 2022, another study published in Nature Climate Change used nearly 120 years of data between 1900 and 2019 and found no change between 1900 and 1980, with a single-sverdrup reduction in AMOC strength not emerging until 1980 \u2013 a variation which remains within range of natural variability.[5] A March 2022 review article concluded that while there may be a long-term weakening of the AMOC caused by global warming, it remains difficult to detect when analyzing its evolution since 1980, as that time frame presents both periods of weakening and strengthening, and the magnitude of either change is uncertain (in range between 5% and 25%). The review concluded with a call for more sensitive and longer-term research.[71]\n\nObservations [ edit ]\n\nA 2021 comparison of the post-2004 RAPID observations with the 1980-2004 reconstructed AMOC trend.\n\nDirect observations of the strength of the AMOC have been available only since 2004 from the RAPID array, an in situ mooring array at 26\u00b0N in the Atlantic, leaving only indirect evidence of the previous AMOC behavior.[72][68] While climate models predict a weakening of AMOC under global warming scenarios, they often struggle to match observations or reconstructions of the current. In particular, observed decline in the period 2004\u20132014 was of a factor 10 higher than that predicted by climate models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5): however, some scientists attributed this to a larger-than-anticipated interdecadal variability of the circulation, rather than a climate-forced trend, suggesting that the AMOC would recover from it in only a few years.[73][74] In February 2021, a study indicated that the AMOC did in fact recover from that decline, and found no evidence of an overall AMOC decline over the past 30 years.[70] Likewise, a Science Advances study published in 2020 found no significant change in the AMOC circulation relative to 1990s, in spite of the substantial changes in the North Atlantic Ocean over the same period.[75]\n\n2010 and earlier [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2004, the hypothesis that the Gulf Stream is switching off received a boost when a retrospective analysis of U.S. satellite data seemed to show a slowing of the North Atlantic Gyre, the northern swirl of the Gulf Stream.[76]\n\nIn May 2005, Peter Wadhams reported in The Times (London) about the results of investigations in a submarine under the Arctic ice sheet measuring the giant chimneys of cold dense water, in which the cold dense water normally sinks down to the sea bed and is replaced by warm water, forming one of the engines of the North Atlantic Drift. He and his team found the chimneys to have virtually disappeared. Normally there are seven to twelve giant columns, but Wadhams found only two giant columns, both extremely weak.[77][78]\n\nIn 2005 a 30% reduction in the warm currents that carry water north from the Gulf Stream was observed from the last such measurement in 1992. The authors noted uncertainties in the measurements.[79] Following media discussions, Detlef Quadfasel pointed out that the uncertainty of the estimates of Bryden et al. is high, but says other factors and observations do support their results, and implications based on palaeoclimate records show drops of air temperature up to 10 \u00b0C within decades, linked to abrupt switches of ocean circulation when a certain threshold is reached. He concluded that further observations and modelling are crucial for providing early warning of a possible devastating breakdown of the circulation.[80] In response Quirin Schiermeier concluded that natural variation was the culprit for the observations but highlighted possible implications.[81][82]\n\nIn 2008, Vage et al. reported \"the return of deep convection to the subpolar gyre in both the Labrador and Irminger seas in the winter of 2007\u20132008,\" employing \"profiling float data from the Argo program to document deep mixing,\" and \"a variety of in situ, satellite and reanalysis data\" to set the context for the phenomenon. This might have a lot to do with the observations of variations in cold water chimney behaviour.[83]\n\nSlowdown or possible shutdown of the thermohaline circulation [ edit ]\n\nA summary of the path of the thermohaline circulation. Blue paths represent deep-water currents, while red paths represent surface currents\n\nAn overview of the global thermohaline circulation. It shows how there is a northward surface flow in the Atlantic Ocean, which sinks and reverses direction in the Arctic. The freshening of the Arctic surface waters by meltwater could lead to a tipping point. This would have large effects on the strength and direction of the AMOC, with serious consequences for nature and human society.\n\nThe slowdown or shutdown of the thermohaline circulation is a hypothesized effect of climate change on a major ocean circulation. The Gulf Stream is part of this circulation, and is part of the reason why northern Europe is warmer than it would normally be; Edinburgh has the same latitude as Moscow. The Thermohaline Circulation influences the climate all over the world. The impacts of the decline and potential shutdown of the AMOC could include losses in agricultural output, ecosystem changes, and the triggering of other climate tipping points.[10] Other likely impacts of AMOC decline include reduced precipitation in mid-latitudes, changing patterns of strong precipitation in the tropics and Europe, and strengthening storms that follow the North Atlantic track. Finally, a decline would also be accompanied by strong sea level rise along the eastern North American coast.[54]\n\nAMOC stability [ edit ]\n\nAtlantic overturning is not a static feature of global circulation, but rather a sensitive function of temperature and salinity distributions as well as atmospheric forcings. Paleoceanographic reconstructions of AMOC vigour and configuration have revealed significant variations over geologic time[84][85] complementing variation observed on shorter scales.[86][73]\n\nReconstructions of a \"shutdown\" or \"Heinrich\" mode of the North Atlantic have fuelled concerns about a future collapse of the overturning circulation due to global climate change. The physics of a shutdown would be underpinned by the Stommel Bifurcation, where increased freshwater forcing or warmer surface waters would lead to a sudden reduction in overturning from which the forcing must be substantially reduced before restart is possible.[87] In 2022, a study suggested that the strongly increasing \"memory\" of the past multidecadal variations in the system's circulation could act as an early warning indicator of a tipping point.[88]\n\nAn AMOC shutdown would be fuelled by two positive feedbacks, the accumulation of both freshwater and heat in areas of downwelling. AMOC exports freshwater from the North Atlantic, and a reduction in overturning would freshen waters and inhibit downwelling.[89] Similar to its export of freshwater, AMOC also partitions heat in the deep-ocean in a global warming regime \u2013 it is possible that a weakened AMOC would lead to increasing global temperatures and further stratification and slowdown.[28] However, this effect would be tempered by a concomitant reduction in warm water transport to the North Atlantic under a weakened AMOC, a negative feedback on the system. Moreover, a paleoceanographic reconstruction from 2022 found only a limited impact from massive freshwater forcing of the final Holocene deglaciation ~11,700\u20136,000 years ago, when the sea level rise amounted to around 50 metres. It suggested that most models overestimate the impact of freshwater forcing on AMOC.[21]\n\nTo complicate the issue of positive and negative feedbacks on temperature and salinity, the wind-driven component of AMOC is still not fully constrained. A relatively larger role of atmospheric forcing would lead to less dependency on the thermohaline factors listed above, and would render AMOC less vulnerable to temperature and salinity changes under global warming.[90]\n\nMultiple equilibria versus single equilibrium [ edit ]\n\nAs well as paleoceanographic reconstruction, the mechanism and likelihood of collapse has been investigated using climate models. Earth Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) have historically predicted a modern AMOC to have multiple equilibria, characterised as warm, cold and shutdown modes.[91] This is in contrast to more comprehensive models, which bias towards a stable AMOC characterised by a single equilibrium. However, doubt is cast upon this stability by a modelled northward freshwater flux which is at odds with observations.[73][92] An unphysical northward flux in models acts as a negative feedback on overturning and falsely biases towards stability.[13] On the other hand, it was also suggested that the stationary freshwater forcing used in the classic EMICs is too simplistic, and a 2022 study which modified a Stommel's Bifurcation EMIC to use more realistic transient freshwater flux found that this change delayed tipping behavior in the model by over 1000 years. The study suggested that this simulation is more consistent with the reconstructions of AMOC response to Meltwater pulse 1A, when a similarly long delay was observed.[22]\n\nImpacts of a slowdown [ edit ]\n\nDon Chambers from the University of South Florida College of Marine Science mentioned: \"The major effect of a slowing AMOC is expected to be cooler winters and summers around the North Atlantic, and small regional increases in sea level on the North American coast.\"[93] James Hansen and Makiko Sato stated:\n\nAMOC slowdown that causes cooling ~1 \u00b0C and perhaps affects weather patterns is very different from an AMOC shutdown that cools the North Atlantic several degrees Celsius; the latter would have dramatic effects on storms and be irreversible on the century time scale.[94]\n\nA 2005 paper suggested that a severe AMOC slowdown would collapse North Atlantic plankton counts to less than half of their pre-disruption biomass due to the increased stratification and the severe drop in nutrient exchange amongst the ocean layers.[9] In 2019, a study suggested that the observed ~10% decline in the phytoplankton productivity in the North Atlantic may provide evidence for this hypothesis.[95]\n\nDownturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has been tied to extreme regional sea level rise.[96] A 2015 paper simulated global ocean changes under AMOC slowdown and collapse scenarios and found that it would greatly decrease dissolved oxygen content in the North Atlantic, even as it would slightly increase globally due to greater increases across the other oceans.[97] In 2018, AMOC slowdown was also tied to increasing coastal deoxygenation.[98] In 2020, it was linked to increasing salinity in the South Atlantic.[99]\n\nA study published in 2016 found further evidence for a considerable impact of a slowdown on sea level rise around the U.S. East Coast. The study confirms earlier research findings which identified the region as a hotspot for rising seas, with a potential to divert 3\u20134 times in the rate of rise, compared to the global average. The researchers attribute the possible increase to an ocean circulation mechanism called deep water formation, which is reduced due to AMOC slow down, leading to more warmer water pockets below the surface. Additionally, the study noted, \"Our results suggest that higher carbon emission rates also contribute to increased [sea level rise] in this region compared to the global average.\"[100] In 2021, another paper had also suggested that the slowdown had played a role in the northeastern coast of the United States ending up as one of the fastest-warming regions of North America.[101][102]\n\nIn 2020, a study evaluated the effects of projected AMOC weakening in the 21st century under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, which portrays a future of continually increasing emissions. In this scenario, a weakened AMOC would also slow down Arctic sea ice decline and delay the emergence of an ice-free Arctic by around 6 years, as well as preventing over 50% of sea ice loss on the edges of Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk in the years 2061\u20132080. It also found a southward displacement of Intertropical Convergence Zone, with the associated rainfall increases to the north of it over the tropical Atlantic Ocean and decreases to the south, but cautioned that those trends would be dwarved by the far larger changes in precipitation associated with RCP 8.5. Finally, it found that this slowdown would further deepen Icelandic Low and Aleutian Low due to the displacement of westerly jets.[103]\n\nA proposed tipping cascade where the AMOC would mediate a connection between the other tipping elements.\n\nIn 2021, a conceptual network model was developed, connecting the AMOC, Greenland ice sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Amazon rainforest (all well-known climate tipping points) through a set of simplified equations. It suggested that while changes to AMOC are unlikely to trigger tipping behaviour in those other elements of the climate system on their own, any other climate element transitioning towards tipping would also affect the others through a connection mediated by the AMOC slowdown, potentially initiating a tipping cascade across multi-century timescales. Consequently, AMOC slowdown would reduce the global warming threshold beyond which any of those four elements (including the AMOC itself) could be expected to tip, as opposed to thresholds established from studying those elements in isolation.[104]\n\nA 2021 assessment of the economic impact of climate tipping points found that while tipping points in general would likely increase the social cost of carbon by about 25%, with a 10% chance of tipping points more than doubling it, AMOC slowdown is likely to do the opposite and reduce the social cost of carbon by about \u22121.4%, since it would act to counteract the effects of warming in Europe, which is more developed and thus represents a larger fraction of the global GDP than the regions which would be impacted negatively by the slowdown.[105] The following year, this finding, and the broader findings of the study, were severely criticized by a group of scientists including Steve Keen and Timothy Lenton, who considered those findings to be a severe underestimate.[106] The authors have responded to this criticism by noting that their paper should be treated as the starting point in economic assessment of tipping points rather than the final word, and since most of the literature included in their meta-analysis lacks the ability to estimate nonmarket climate damages, their numbers are likely to be underestimates.[107]\n\nImpacts of a shutdown [ edit ]\n\nModelled 21st century warming under the \"intermediate\" global warming scenario (top).

The collapse of the entire Atlantic Meriditional Overturning Circulation (bottom).\n\nThe possibility that the AMOC is a bistable system (which is either \"on\" or \"off\") and could collapse suddenly has been a topic of scientific discussion for a long time.[108][109] In 2004, The Guardian publicized the findings of a report commissioned by Pentagon defence adviser Andrew Marshall, which suggested that the average annual temperature in Europe would drop by 6 Fahrenheit between 2010 and 2020 as the result of an abrupt AMOC shutdown.[110]\n\nIn general, a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation (THC) caused by global warming would trigger cooling in the North Atlantic, Europe, and North America.[111][112] This would particularly affect areas such as the British Isles, France and the Nordic countries, which are warmed by the North Atlantic drift.[113][114] Major consequences, apart from regional cooling, could also include an increase in major floods and storms, a collapse of plankton stocks, warming or rainfall changes in the tropics or Alaska and Antarctica, more frequent and intense El Ni\u00f1o events due to associated shutdowns of the Kuroshio, Leeuwin, and East Australian Currents that are connected to the same thermohaline circulation as the Gulf Stream, or an oceanic anoxic event \u2014 oxygen (O\n\n2 ) below surface levels of the stagnant oceans becomes completely depleted \u2013 a probable cause of past mass extinction events.[81]\n\nIn 2002, a study had suggested that an AMOC shutdown may be able to trigger the type of abrupt massive temperature shifts which occurred during the last glacial period: a series of Dansgaard-Oeschger events \u2013 rapid climate fluctuations \u2013 may be attributed to freshwater forcing at high latitude interrupting the THC. 2002 model runs in which the THC is forced to shut down do show cooling \u2013 locally up to 8 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F).[115] A 2017 review concluded that there is strong evidence for past changes in the strength and structure of the AMOC during abrupt climate events such as the Younger Dryas and many of the Heinrich events.[116]\n\nA 2015 study led by James Hansen found that the shutdown or substantial slowdown of the AMOC, besides possibly contributing to extreme end-Eemian events, will cause a more general increase of severe weather. Additional surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower tropospheric temperature gradients, and causes in model simulations a large increase of mid-latitude eddy energy throughout the midlatitude troposphere. This in turn leads to an increase of baroclinicity produced by stronger temperature gradients, which provides energy for more severe weather events. This includes winter and near-winter cyclonic storms colloquially known as \"superstorms\", which generate near-hurricane-force winds and often large amounts of snowfall. These results imply that strong cooling in the North Atlantic from AMOC shutdown potentially increases seasonal mean wind speed of the northeasterlies by as much as 10\u201320% relative to preindustrial conditions. Because wind power dissipation is proportional to the cube of wind speed, this translates into an increase of storm power dissipation by a factor ~1.4\u20132,. However, the simulated changes refer to seasonal mean winds averaged over large grid-boxes, not individual storms.[12]\n\nIn 2017, a study evaluated the effects of a shutdown on El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but found no overall impact, with divergent atmospheric processes cancelling each other out.[117] In 2021, a study using a Community Earth System Model suggested that an AMOC slowdown could nevertheless increase the strength of El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation and thus amplify climate extremes, especially if another Meridional Overturning Circulation develops in the Pacific Ocean in response to AMOC slowdown.[118] In contrast, a 2022 study showed that an AMOC collapse is likely to accelerate the Pacific trade winds and Walker circulation, while weakening Indian and South Atlantic subtropical highs.[119] The next study from the same team showed that the result of those altered atmospheric patterns is a ~30% reduction in ENSO variability and a ~95% reduction in the frequency of extreme El Ni\u00f1o events. Unlike today, El Ni\u00f1o events become more frequent in the central rather than eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o events.[120] At the same time, this would essentially make a La Nina state dominant across the globe, likely leading to more frequent extreme rainfall over eastern Australia and worse droughts and bushfire seasons over southwestern United States.[121]\n\nIn 2020, a study had assessed the impact of an AMOC collapse on farming and food production in Great Britain.[122] It estimated that AMOC collapse would reverse the impact of global warming in Great Britain and cause an average temperature drop of 3.4 \u00b0C. Moreover, it would lower rainfall during the growing season by around <123mm, which would in turn reduce the land area suitable for arable farming from the 32% to 7%. The net value of British farming would decline by around \u00a3346 million per year, or over 10%.[11]\n\nA 2021 study used a simplified modelling approach to evaluate the impact of a shutdown on the Amazon rainforest and its hypothesized dieback and transition to a savannah state in some climate change scenarios. It suggested that a shutdown would enhance rainfall over the southern Amazon due to the shift of an Intertropical Convergence Zone and thus would help to counter the dieback and potentially stabilize at least the southern part of the rainforest.[123]\n\nProjections [ edit ]\n\nThe research around the future strength of the AMOC is shown below in chronological order. It is primarily based on Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models projections, although large reviews like the IPCC reports are also informed by the present-day observations and historical reconstructions, which allows them to take a wider range of possibilities into account and assign likelihood to the events not explicitly covered by the models.\n\nAround 2001, the IPCC Third Assessment Report projected high confidence that the THC would tend to weaken rather than stop, and that the warming effects would outweigh the cooling, even over Europe.[124]\n\nWhen the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report was published in 2014, a rapid transition of the AMOC was considered very unlikely, and this assessment was offered at a high confidence level.[125] That assessment had several limitations, such a reported bias of CMIP models towards AMOC stability,[16] and the insufficient analysis of the impacts on circulation caused by Greenland ice sheet meltwater intrusion.\n\nIn 2016, a study aimed to redress this shortcoming by adding Greenland ice sheet melt estimates to the projections from eight state-of-the-art climate models. It found that by 2090\u20132100, the AMOC would weaken by around 18% (with a range of potential weakening between 3% and 34%) under the \"intermediate\" Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, while it would weaken by 37% (with a range between 15% and 65%) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, which presents a scenario of continually increasing emissions. When the two scenarios are extended past 2100, AMOC stabilized under RCP 4.5, but continues to decline under RCP 8.5, with an average decline of 74% by 2290\u20132300 and a 44% likelihood of an outright collapse.[14]\n\nIn 2017, another study applied bias correction to Community Climate System Model and simulated an idealized scenario where CO 2 concentrations abruptly double from 1990 levels and remain stable afterwards: according to the authors, such concentrations would result in a warming approximately between RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0. The AMOC remained stable in a standard model, but collapsed after 300 years of simulation in a bias-corrected model.[13] In 2020, a study ran simulations of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 between 2005 and 2250 in a Community Earth System Model integrated with an advanced ocean physics module which allowed for a more realistic representation of Antarctic ice sheet meltwater. Freshwater input was between 4 and 8 times higher in the modified RCP 4.5 scenario compared to the control run (an increase from 0.1 to 0.4\u20130.8 sverdrup), and 5 to 10 times stronger in the modified RCP 8.5 scenario (from 0.2 to an average of 1 sverdrup, with the peak values over 2 sverdrup around 2125 due to the collapse of the Ross Ice Shelf). In both RCP 4.5 simulations, AMOC declines from its current strength of 24 sverdrup to 19 sverdrup by 2100: after 2200, it begins to recover in the control simulation but stays at 19 sverdrup in the modified simulation. Under both RCP 8.5 simulations, there's a near-collapse of the current as it declines to 8 sverdrup past 2100 and stays at that level until the end of the simulation period: in the modified simulation, it takes 35 years longer to reach 8 sverdrup than in the control run.[126]\n\nAnother study published in 2020 analyzed how the AMOC would be impacted by temperature stabilizing at 1.5 degrees, 2 degrees (the two Paris Agreement goals, both well below the warming under of RCP 4.5) or 3 degrees by 2100 (slightly above the expected warming by 2100 under RCP 4.5). In all three cases, the AMOC declines for an additional 5\u201310 years after the temperature rise ceases, but it does not come close to collapse, and recovers its strength after about 150 years.[15]\n\nIn 2021, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report again assessed that the AMOC is very likely to decline within the 21st century, and expressed high confidence that changes to it would be reversible within centuries if the warming was reversed.[7]: 19 Unlike the Fifth Assessment Report, it had only expressed medium confidence rather than high confidence in AMOC avoiding a collapse before the end of the century. This reduction in confidence was likely influenced by several review studies drawing attention to the circulation stability bias within general circulation models,[127][128] as well as simplified ocean modelling studies suggesting that the AMOC may be more vulnerable to abrupt change than what the larger-scale models suggest.[17]\n\nIn 2022, a study performed modelling experiments with three climate models participating in Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project, and it found that very aggressive mitigation of air pollution like particulates and ground-level ozone could weaken AMOC circulation by 10% by the end of the century if it happened on its own, due to the reduction in climate-cooling stratospheric sulfur aerosols. The authors recommended pairing air pollution mitigation with the mitigation of methane emissions to avoid this outcome, as both methane (a strong warming agent) and sulfate aerosols (a cooling agent) are similarly short-lived in the atmosphere, and a simultaneous reduction of both would cancel out their effects.[129]\n\nIn 2022, an extensive assessment of all potential climate tipping points identified 16 plausible climate tipping points, including a collapse of the AMOC. It suggested that a collapse would most likely be triggered by 4 degrees Celsius of global warming, but that there's enough uncertainty to suggest it could be triggered at warming levels as low as 1.4 degrees, or as high as 8 degrees. Likewise, it estimates that once AMOC collapse is triggered, it would most likely take place over 50 years, but the entire range is between 15 and 300 years. Finally, it concludes that this collapse would lower global temperatures by around 0.5 degrees Celsius, while regional temperatures in Europe would go down by between 4 and 10 degrees Celsius.[130][131] That assessment also treated the collapse of the Northern Subpolar Gyre as a potential separate tipping point, which could occur at between 1.1 degrees and 3.8 degrees of warming (although this is only simulated by a fraction of climate models). The most likely figure is 1.8 degrees, and once triggered, the collapse of the gyre would most likely take 10 years from start to end, with a range between 5 and 50 years. The loss of this convection is estimated to lower the global temperature by 0.5 degrees, while the average temperature in Europe decreases by around 3 degrees. There are also substantial impacts on regional precipitation.\n\nIn July 2023, a paper from a pair of University of Copenhagen researchers suggested that AMOC collapse would most likely happen around 2057, with the 95% confidence range between 2025 - 2095.[19] However, it relied on a lower-complexity model, and its findings have been very controversial amongst the rest of the scientific community. While some have described this research as \"worrisome\" and a \"valuable contribution\" to existing literature even while cautioning its results could apply to a slowdown as much as to a complete collapse, others questioned the accuracy and relevance of proxy data chosen as the basis for the paper, with one scientist saying that the projection had \"feet of clay\" as the result.[20]\n\nSociety and culture [ edit ]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nThe film The Day After Tomorrow and the British TV Series Ice both explore exaggerated scenarios related to the AMOC shutdown.\n\nAn Inconvenient Truth includes reference to the potential shutdown of the AMOC and its impact on temperatures in Europe if ice sheets were to melt and cause elevated freshwater flows in the North Atlantic.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson's science-fiction novel Fifty Degrees Below, a volume in his Science in the Capital series, depicts a shutdown of thermohaline circulation and mankind's efforts to counteract it by adding great quantities of salt to the ocean.\n\nIn Ian Douglas' Star Corpsman novels, an AMOC shutdown triggers an early glacial maximum, covering most of Canada and northern Europe in ice sheets by the mid-22nd century.\n\nSee also [ edit ]"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_d5db3071-0170-4aca-8bb7-61685b4ab774"}

It is a Greek word that translates to the state or condition of 'good spirit' and is commonly translated as 'happiness' or 'welfare' [5]. The concept of eudaimonia was closely tied to the terms aret\u0113 (translated as 'virtue' or 'excellence') and phronesis ('practical or ethical wisdom') [5].\n\nAncient Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics held discussions and debates about the links between \u0113thik\u0113 aret\u0113 (virtue of character) and eudaimonia (happiness) [5].

Mishima is considered one of the most important writers of the 20th century. He was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968, but the award went to his countryman and benefactor Yasunari Kawabata.[6] His works include the novels Confessions of a Mask (\u4eee\u9762\u306e\u544a\u767d, Kamen no kokuhaku) and The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (\u91d1\u95a3\u5bfa, Kinkaku-ji), and the autobiographical essay Sun and Steel (\u592a\u967d\u3068\u9244, Taiy\u014d to tetsu). Mishima's work is characterized by \"its luxurious vocabulary and decadent metaphors, its fusion of traditional Japanese and modern Western literary styles, and its obsessive assertions of the unity of beauty, eroticism and death\",[7] according to author Andrew Rankin.\n\nMishima's political activities made him a controversial figure, which he remains in modern Japan.[8][9][10][11] From his mid-30s, Mishima's right-wing ideology and reactionary beliefs were increasingly evident.[11][12][13] He was proud of the traditional culture and spirit of Japan, and opposed what he saw as western-style materialism, along with Japan's postwar democracy, globalism, and communism, worrying that by embracing these ideas the Japanese people would lose their \"national essence\" (kokutai) and their distinctive cultural heritage (Shinto and Yamato-damashii) to become a \"rootless\" people.[14][15][16][17] Mishima formed the Tatenokai for the avowed purpose of restoring sacredness and dignity to the Emperor of Japan.[15][16][17] On 25 November 1970, Mishima and four members of his militia entered a military base in central Tokyo, took its commandant hostage, and unsuccessfully tried to inspire the Japan Self-Defense Forces to rise up and overthrow Japan's 1947 Constitution (which he called \"a constitution of defeat\").[17][14] After his speech and screaming of \"Long live the Emperor!\", he committed seppuku.\n\nLife and work [ edit ]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nMishima in his childhood (April 1931, at the age of 6)\n\nKimitake Hiraoka (\u5e73\u5ca1\u516c\u5a01, Hiraoka Kimitake), later known as Yukio Mishima (\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b, Mishima Yukio), was born in Nagazumi-cho, Yotsuya-ku of Tokyo City (now part of Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo). He chose his pen name when he was 16.[18] His father was Azusa Hiraoka (\u5e73\u5ca1\u6893), a government official in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce,[19] and his mother, Shizue (\u5e73\u5ca1\u502d\u6587\u91cd), was the daughter of the 5th principal of the Kaisei Academy. Shizue's father, Kenz\u014d Hashi (\u6a4b\u5065\u4e09), was a scholar of the Chinese classics, and the Hashi family had served the Maeda clan for generations in Kaga Domain. Mishima's paternal grandparents were Sadatar\u014d Hiraoka (\u5e73\u5ca1\u5b9a\u592a\u90ce), the third Governor-General of Karafuto Prefecture, and Natsuko (family register name: Natsu) (\u5e73\u5ca1\u306a\u3064). Mishima received his birth name Kimitake (\u516c\u5a01, also read K\u014di in on-yomi) in honor of Furuichi K\u014di (\u53e4\u5e02\u516c\u5a01) who was a benefactor of Sadatar\u014d.[20] He had a younger sister, Mitsuko (\u5e73\u5ca1\u7f8e\u6d25\u5b50), who died of typhus in 1945 at the age of 17, and a younger brother, Chiyuki (\u5e73\u5ca1\u5343\u4e4b).[21][1]\n\nMishima's childhood home was a rented house, though a fairly large two-floor house that was the largest in the neighborhood. He lived with his parents, siblings and paternal grandparents, as well as six maids, a houseboy, and a manservant. His grandfather was in debt, so there were no remarkable household items left on the first floor.[22]\n\nMishima's early childhood was dominated by the presence of his grandmother, Natsuko, who took the boy and separated him from his immediate family for several years.[23] She was the granddaughter of Matsudaira Yoritaka (\u677e\u5e73\u983c\u4f4d), the daimy\u014d of Shishido, which was a branch domain of Mito Domain in Hitachi Province;[b] therefore, Mishima was a descendant of the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu (\u5fb3\u5ddd\u5bb6\u5eb7), through his grandmother.[24][25][26] Natsuko's father, Nagai Iwanoj\u014d (\u6c38\u4e95\u5ca9\u4e4b\u4e1e), had been a Supreme Court justice, and Iwanoj\u014d's adoptive father, Nagai Naoyuki (\u6c38\u4e95\u5c1a\u5fd7), had been a bannerman of the Tokugawa House during the Bakumatsu.[24] Natsuko had been raised in the household of Prince Arisugawa Taruhito, and she maintained considerable aristocratic pretensions even after marrying Sadatar\u014d, a bureaucrat who had made his fortune in the newly opened colonial frontier in the north, and who eventually became Governor-General of Karafuto Prefecture on Sakhalin Island.[27] Sadatar\u014d's father, Takichi Hiraoka (\u5e73\u5ca1\u592a\u5409), and grandfather, Tazaemon Hiraoka (\u5e73\u5ca1\u592a\u5de6\u885b\u9580), had been farmers.[24][c] Natsuko was prone to violent outbursts, which are occasionally alluded to in Mishima's works,[29] and to whom some biographers have traced Mishima's fascination with death.[30] She did not allow Mishima to venture into the sunlight, engage in any kind of sport, or play with other boys. He spent much of his time either alone or with female cousins and their dolls.[31][29]\n\nMishima returned to his immediate family when he was 12. His father Azusa had a taste for military discipline, and worried Natsuko's style of childrearing was too soft. When Mishima was an infant, Azusa employed parenting tactics such as holding Mishima up to the side of a speeding train. He also raided his son's room for evidence of an \"effeminate\" interest in literature, and often ripped his son's manuscripts apart.[32] Although Azusa forbade him to write any further stories, Mishima continued to write in secret, supported and protected by his mother, who was always the first to read a new story.[32]\n\nWhen Mishima was 13, Natsuko took him to see his first Kabuki play: Kanadehon Ch\u016bshingura, an allegory of the story of the 47 R\u014dnin. He was later taken to his first Noh play (Miwa, a story featuring Amano-Iwato) by his maternal grandmother Tomi Hashi (\u6a4b\u30c8\u30df). From these early experiences, Mishima became addicted to Kabuki and Noh. He began attending performances every month and grew deeply interested in these traditional Japanese dramatic art forms.[33]\n\nSchooling and early works [ edit ]\n\nMishima's self-portrait drawn in junior high school\n\nMishima was enrolled at the age of six in the elite Gakush\u016bin, the Peers' School in Tokyo, which had been established in the Meiji period to educate the Imperial family and the descendants of the old feudal nobility.[34] At 12, Mishima began to write his first stories. He read myths (Kojiki, Greek mythology, etc.) and the works of numerous classic Japanese authors as well as Raymond Radiguet, Jean Cocteau, Oscar Wilde, Rainer Maria Rilke, Thomas Mann, Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Baudelaire, l'Isle-Adam, and other European authors in translation. He also studied German. After six years at school, he became the youngest member of the editorial board of its literary society. Mishima was attracted to the works of the Japanese poet Shizuo It\u014d (\u4f0a\u6771\u9759\u96c4, It\u014d Shizuo), poet and novelist Haruo Sat\u014d (\u4f50\u85e4\u6625\u592b), and poet Michiz\u014d Tachihara (\u7acb\u539f\u9053\u9020), who inspired Mishima's appreciation of classical Japanese waka poetry. Mishima's early contributions to the Gakush\u016bin literary magazine Hojinkai-zasshi (\u8f14\u4ec1\u4f1a\u96d1\u8a8c) included haiku and waka poetry before he turned his attention to prose.[35]\n\nIn 1941, at the age of 16, Mishima was invited to write a short story for the Hojinkai-zasshi, and he submitted Forest in Full Bloom (\u82b1\u3056\u304b\u308a\u306e\u68ee, Hanazakari no Mori), a story in which the narrator describes the feeling that his ancestors somehow still live within him. The story uses the type of metaphors and aphorisms that became Mishima's trademarks.[d] He mailed a copy of the manuscript to his Japanese teacher Fumio Shimizu (\u6e05\u6c34\u6587\u96c4) for constructive criticism. Shimizu was so impressed that he took the manuscript to a meeting of the editorial board of the prestigious literary magazine Bungei Bunka (\u6587\u85dd\u6587\u5316), of which he was a member. At the editorial board meeting, the other board members read the story and were very impressed; they congratulated themselves for discovering a genius and published it in the magazine. The story was later published as a limited book edition (4,000 copies) in 1944 due to a wartime paper shortage. Mishima had it published as a keepsake to remember him by, as he assumed that he would die in the war.[38][32]\n\nIn order to protect him from potential backlash from Azusa, Shimizu and the other editorial board members coined the pen-name Yukio Mishima.[39] They took \"Mishima\" from Mishima Station, which Shimizu and fellow Bungei Bunka board member Hasuda Zenmei passed through on their way to the editorial meeting, which was held in Izu, Shizuoka. The name \"Yukio\" came from yuki (\u96ea), the Japanese word for \"snow\", because of the snow they saw on Mount Fuji as the train passed.[39] In the magazine, Hasuda praised Mishima's genius as follows:\n\nThis youthful author is a heaven-sent child of eternal Japanese history. He is much younger than we are, but has arrived on the scene already quite mature.[40]\n\nHasuda, who became something of a mentor to Mishima, was an ardent nationalist and a fan of Motoori Norinaga (1730\u20131801), a scholar of kokugaku from the Edo period who preached Japanese traditional values and devotion to the Emperor.[41] Hasuda had previously fought for the Imperial Japanese Army in China in 1938, and in 1943 he was recalled to active service for deployment as a first lieutenant in the Southeast Asian theater.[42] At a farewell party thrown for Hasuda by the Bungei Bunka group, Hasuda offered the following parting words to Mishima:\n\nI have entrusted the future of Japan to you.\n\nAccording to Mishima, these words were deeply meaningful to him, and had a profound effect on the future course of his life.[43][44][45]\n\nLater in 1941, Mishima wrote in his notebook an essay about his deep devotion to Shint\u014d, titled The Way of the Gods (\u60df\u795e\u4e4b\u9053, Kannagara no michi).[46] Mishima's story The Cigarette (\u7159\u8349, Tabako), published in 1946, describes a homosexual love he felt at school and being teased from members of the school's rugby union club because he belonged to the literary society. Another story from 1954, The Boy Who Wrote Poetry (\u8a69\u3092\u66f8\u304f\u5c11\u5e74, Shi o kaku sh\u014dnen), was also based on Mishima's memories of his time at Gakush\u016bin Junior High School.[47]\n\nOn 9 September 1944, Mishima graduated Gakush\u016bin High School at the top of the class, and became a graduate representative.[48][49] Emperor Hirohito was present at the graduation ceremony, and Mishima later received a silver watch from the Emperor at the Imperial Household Ministry.[48][49][50][51]\n\nOn 27 April 1944, during the final years of World War II, Mishima received a draft notice for the Imperial Japanese Army and barely passed his conscription examination on 16 May 1944, with a less desirable rating of \"second class\" conscript. He had a cold during his medical check on convocation day (10 February 1945), and the young army doctor misdiagnosed Mishima with tuberculosis, declared him unfit for service, and sent him home.[52][32] Scholars have argued that Mishima's failure to receive a \"first class\" rating on his conscription exam (reserved only for the most physically fit recruits), in combination with the illness which led him to be erroneously declared unfit for duty, contributed to an inferiority complex over his frail constitution that later led to his obsession with physical fitness and bodybuilding.[53]\n\nThe day before his failed medical exam, Mishima wrote a farewell message to his family, ending with the words \"Long live the Emperor!\" (\u5929\u7687\u965b\u4e0b\u4e07\u6b73, Tenn\u014d heika banzai), and prepared clippings of his hair and nails to be kept as mementos by his parents.[32][54] The troops of the unit that Mishima was supposed to have joined were sent to the Philippines, where most of them were killed.[52] Mishima's parents were ecstatic that he did not have to go to war, but Mishima's mood was harder to read; Mishima's mother overheard him say he wished he could have joined a \"Special Attack\" (\u7279\u653b, tokk\u014d) unit.[32] Around that time, Mishima admired kamikaze pilots and other \"special attack\" units in letters to friends and private notes.[48][55][56]\n\nMishima was deeply affected by Emperor Hirohito's radio broadcast announcing Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945, and vowed to protect Japanese cultural traditions and help rebuild Japanese culture after the destruction of the war.[57] He wrote in his diary:\n\nOnly by preserving Japanese irrationality will we be able contribute to world culture 100 years from now.[58]\n\nMishima at age 19, with his sister at age 16 (on 9 September 1944)\n\nOn 19 August, four days after Japan's surrender, Mishima's mentor Zenmei Hasuda, who had been drafted and deployed to the Malay peninsula, shot and killed his superior officer who attributed the defeat to the Emperor and slandered the imperial army's future and preached the destruction of the Japanese spirit.[59] Hasuda had long suspected the officer to be a Korean spy.[59] After shooting him, Hasuda turned his pistol on himself.[59] Mishima learned of the incident a year later and contributed poetry in Hasuda's honor at a memorial service in November 1946.[59] On 23 October 1945 (Showa 20), Mishima's beloved younger sister Mitsuko died suddenly at the age of 17 from typhoid fever by drinking untreated water.[32][60] Around that same time he also learned that Kuniko Mitani (\u4e09\u8c37\u90a6\u5b50), a classmate's sister whom he had hoped to marry, was engaged to another man.[61][62][e] These tragic incidents in 1945 became a powerful motive force in inspiring Mishima's future literary work.[64]\n\nAt the end of the war, his father Azusa \"half-allowed\" Mishima to become a novelist. He was worried that his son could actually become a professional novelist, and hoped instead that his son would be a bureaucrat like himself and Mishima's grandfather Sadatar\u014d. He advised his son to enroll in the Faculty of Law instead of the literature department.[32] Attending lectures during the day and writing at night, Mishima graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1947. He obtained a position in the Ministry of the Treasury and seemed set up for a promising career as a government bureaucrat. However, after just one year of employment Mishima had exhausted himself so much that his father agreed to allow him to resign from his post and devote himself to writing full time.[32]\n\nIn 1945, Mishima began the short story A Story at the Cape (\u5cac\u306b\u3066\u306e\u7269\u8a9e, Misaki nite no Monogatari) and continued to work on it through the end of World War II. After the war, it was praised by Shizuo It\u014d whom Mishima respected.[65]\n\nPost-war literature [ edit ]\n\nMishima with his cat (\" Asahi Graph \" 12 May 1948 issue)\n\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the country was occupied by the U.S.-led Allied Powers. At the urging of the occupation authorities, many people who held important posts in various fields were purged from public office. The media and publishing industry were also censored, and were not allowed to engage in forms of expression reminiscent of wartime Japanese nationalism.[f] In addition, literary figures, including many of those who had been close to Mishima before the end of the war, were branded \"war criminal literary figures\". Some people denounced them and converted to left-wing politics, whom Mishima criticized as \"opportunists\" in his letters to friends.[68][69][70] Some prominent literary figures became leftists, and joined the Communist Party as a reaction against wartime militarism and writing socialist realist literature that might support the cause of socialist revolution. Their influence had increased in the Japanese literary world following the end of the war, which Mishima found difficult to accept. Although Mishima was just 20 years old at this time, he worried that his type of literature, based on the 1930s Japanese Romantic School (\u65e5\u672c\u6d6a\u66fc\u6d3e, \"Nihon R\u014dman Ha\"), had already become obsolete.[33]\n\nMishima had heard that famed writer Yasunari Kawabata had praised his work before the end of the war. Uncertain of who else to turn to, Mishima took the manuscripts for The Middle Ages (\u4e2d\u4e16, Ch\u016bsei) and The Cigarette (\u7159\u8349, Tabako) with him, visited Kawabata in Kamakura, and asked for his advice and assistance in January 1946.[33] Kawabata was impressed, and in June 1946, following Kawabata's recommendation, \"The Cigarette\" was published in the new literary magazine Ningen (\u4eba\u9593, \"Humanity\"), followed by \"The Middle Ages\" in December 1946.[72] \"The Middle Ages\" is set in Japan's historical Muromachi Period and explores the motif of shud\u014d (\u8846\u9053, man-boy love) against a backdrop of the death of the ninth Ashikaga shogun Ashikaga Yoshihisa (\u8db3\u5229\u7fa9\u5c1a) in battle at the age of 25, and his father Ashikaga Yoshimasa (\u8db3\u5229\u7fa9\u653f)'s resultant sadness. The story features the fictional character Kikuwaka, a beautiful teenage boy who was beloved by both Yoshihisa and Yoshimasa, who fails in an attempt to follow Yoshihisa in death by committing suicide. Thereafter, Kikuwaka devotes himself to spiritualism in an attempt to heal Yoshimasa's sadness by allowing Yoshihisa's ghost to possess his body, and eventually dies in a double-suicide with a miko (\u5deb\u5973, shrine maiden) who falls in love with him. Mishima wrote the story in an elegant style drawing upon medieval Japanese literature and the Ry\u014djin Hish\u014d, a collection of medieval imay\u014d songs. This elevated writing style and the homosexual motif suggest the germ of Mishima's later aesthetics.[72] Later in 1948 Kawabata, who praised this work, published an autobiographical work Boy (\u5c11\u5e74, Sh\u014dnen) describing his experience of falling in love for the first time with a boy two years his junior.[73]\n\nMishima aged 28 (in January 1953)\n\nIn 1946, Mishima began his first novel, Thieves (\u76d7\u8cca, T\u014dzoku), a story about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide. It was published in 1948, and placed Mishima in the ranks of the Second Generation of Postwar Writers. The following year, he published Confessions of a Mask (\u4eee\u9762\u306e\u544a\u767d, Kamen no kokuhaku), a semi-autobiographical account of a young homosexual man who hides behind a mask to fit into society. The novel was extremely successful and made Mishima a celebrity at the age of 24. Around 1949, Mishima also published a literary essay about Kawabata, for whom he had always held a deep appreciation, in Kindai Bungaku (\u8fd1\u4ee3\u6587\u5b66).[74]\n\nMishima enjoyed international travel. In 1952, he took a world tour and published his travelogue as The Cup of Apollo (\u30a2\u30dd\u30ed\u306e\u676f, Aporo no Sakazuki). He visited Greece during his travels, a place which had fascinated him since childhood. His visit to Greece became the basis for his 1954 novel The Sound of Waves (\u6f6e\u9a12, Shiosai), which drew inspiration from the Greek legend of Daphnis and Chloe. The Sound of Waves, set on the small island of \"Kami-shima\" where a traditional Japanese lifestyle continued to be practiced, depicts a pure, simple love between a fisherman and a female pearl and abalone diver (\u6d77\u5973, ama). Although the novel became a best-seller, leftists criticized it for \"glorifying old-fashioned Japanese values\", and some people began calling Mishima a \"fascist\".[75][76][77] Looking back on these attacks in later years, Mishima wrote, \"The ancient community ethics portrayed in this novel were attacked by progressives at the time, but no matter how much the Japanese people changed, these ancient ethics lurk in the bottom of their hearts. We have gradually seen this proven to be the case.\"[78]\n\nYukio Mishima (lower) with Shintaro Ishihara in 1956 (at the roof of the Bungeishunj\u016b Building in Ginza 6-chome)\n\nMishima made use of contemporary events in many of his works. The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (\u91d1\u95a3\u5bfa, Kinkaku-ji), published in 1956, is a fictionalization of the burning down of the Kinkaku-ji Buddhist temple in Kyoto in 1950 by a mentally disturbed monk.[79]\n\nIn 1959, Mishima published the artistically ambitious novel Ky\u014dko no Ie (Ky\u014dko's house) (\u93e1\u5b50\u306e\u5bb6, Ky\u014dko no Ie). The novel tells the interconnected stories of four young men who represented four different facets of Mishima's personality. His athletic side appears as a boxer, his artistic side as a painter, his narcissistic, performative side as an actor, and his secretive, nihilistic side as a businessman who goes through the motions of living a normal life while practicing \"absolute contempt for reality\". According to Mishima, he was attempting to describe the time around 1955 in the novel, when Japan was entering into its era of high economic growth and the phrase \"The postwar is over\" was prevalent.[g] Mishima explained, \"Ky\u014dko no Ie is, so to speak, my research into the nihilism within me.\"[81][82] Although the novel was well received by a small number of critics from the same generation as Mishima and sold 150,000 copies in a month, it was widely panned in broader literary circles,[84] and was rapidly branded as Mishima's first \"failed work\".[85][84] It was Mishima's first major setback as an author, and the book's disastrous reception came as a harsh psychological blow.[86][87]\n\nMany of Mishima's most famous and highly regarded works were written prior to 1960. However, until that year he had not written works that were seen as especially political. In the summer of 1960, Mishima became interested in the massive Anpo protests against an attempt by U.S.-backed Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi to revise the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan (known as \"Anpo\" in Japanese) in order to cement the U.S.\u2013Japan military alliance into place. Although he did not directly participate in the protests, he often went out in the streets to observe the protestors in action and kept extensive newspaper clipping covering the protests. In June 1960, at the climax of the protest movement, Mishima wrote a commentary in the Mainichi Shinbun newspaper, entitled \"A Political Opinion\". In the critical essay, he argued that leftist groups such as the Zengakuren student federation, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party were falsely wrapping themselves in the banner of \"defending democracy\" and using the protest movement to further their own ends. Mishima warned against the dangers of the Japanese people following ideologues who told lies with honeyed words. Although Mishima criticized Kishi as a \"nihilist\" who had subordinated himself to the United States, Mishima concluded that he would rather vote for a strong-willed realist \"with neither dreams nor despair\" than a mendacious but eloquent ideologue.[91]\n\nShortly after the Anpo Protests ended, Mishima began writing one of his most famous short stories, Patriotism (\u6182\u56fd, Y\u016bkoku), glorifying the actions of a young right-wing ultranationalist Japanese army officer who commits suicide after a failed revolt against the government during the February 26 Incident. The following year, he published the first two parts of his three-part play Tenth-Day Chrysanthemum (\u5341\u65e5\u306e\u83ca, T\u014dka no kiku), which celebrates the actions of the 26 February revolutionaries.\n\nMishima's newfound interest in contemporary politics shaped his novel After the Banquet (\u5bb4\u306e\u3042\u3068, Utage no ato), also published in 1960, which so closely followed the events surrounding politician Hachir\u014d Arita's campaign to become governor of Tokyo that Mishima was sued for invasion of privacy.[92] The next year, Mishima published The Frolic of the Beasts (\u7363\u306e\u622f\u308c, Kemono no tawamure), a parody of the classical Noh play Motomezuka, written in the 14th-century playwright Kiyotsugu Kan'ami. In 1962, Mishima produced his most artistically avant-garde work Beautiful Star (\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u661f, Utsukushii hoshi), which at times comes close to science fiction. Although the novel received mixed reviews from the literary world, prominent critic Takeo Okuno singled it out for praise as part of a new breed of novels that was overthrowing longstanding literary conventions in the tumultuous aftermath of the Anpo Protests. Alongside K\u014db\u014d Abe's Woman of the Dunes (\u7802\u306e\u5973, Suna no onna), published that same year, Okuno considered A Beautiful Star an \"epoch-making work\" which broke free of literary taboos and preexisting notions of what literature should be in order to explore the author's personal creativity.\n\nIn 1965, Mishima wrote the play Madame de Sade (\u30b5\u30c9\u4faf\u7235\u592b\u4eba, Sado k\u014dshaku fujin) that explores the complex figure of the Marquis de Sade, traditionally upheld as an exemplar of vice, through a series of debates between six female characters, including the Marquis' wife, the Madame de Sade. At the end of the play, Mishima offers his own interpretation of what he considered to be one of the central mysteries of the de Sade story\u2014the Madame de Sade's unstinting support for her husband while he was in prison and her sudden decision to renounce him upon his release.[94][95] Mishima's play was inspired in part by his friend Tatsuhiko Shibusawa's 1960 Japanese translation of the Marquis de Sade's novel Juliette and a 1964 biography Shibusawa wrote of de Sade.[96] Shibusawa's sexually explicit translation became the focus of a sensational obscenity trial remembered in Japan as the \"Sade Case\" (\u30b5\u30c9\u88c1\u5224, Sado saiban), which was ongoing as Mishima wrote the play.[94] In 1994, Madame de Sade was evaluated as the \"greatest drama in the history of postwar theater\" by Japanese theater criticism magazine Theater Arts.[97][98]\n\nMishima was considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963, 1964, and 1965,[99] and was a favorite of many foreign publications.[100] However, in 1968 his early mentor Kawabata won the Nobel Prize and Mishima realized that the chances of it being given to another Japanese author in the near future were slim.[101] In a work published in 1970, Mishima wrote that the writers he paid most attention to in modern western literature were Georges Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, and Witold Gombrowicz.[102]\n\nActing and modelling [ edit ]\n\nMishima poses for a photograph, 1961.\n\nMishima was also an actor, and starred in Yasuzo Masumura's 1960 film, Afraid to Die (\u304b\u3089\u3063\u98a8\u91ce\u90ce, Karakkaze yar\u014d), for which he also sang the theme song (lyrics by himself; music by Shichir\u014d Fukazawa).[103][104] He performed in films like Patriotism or the Rite of Love and Death (\u6182\u56fd, Y\u016bkoku, directed by himself, 1966), Black Lizard (\u9ed2\u8725\u8734, Kurotokage, directed by Kinji Fukasaku, 1968) and Hitokiri (\u4eba\u65ac\u308a, directed by Hideo Gosha, 1969).\n\nMishima was featured as the photo model in photographer Eikoh Hosoe's book Bara-kei (\u8594\u8587\u5211, Ba-ra-kei: Ordeal by Roses), as well as in Tamotsu Yat\u014d's photobooks Young Samurai: Bodybuilders of Japan (\u4f53\u9053\uff5e\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30dc\u30c7\u30a3\u30d3\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u305f\u3061, Taid\u014d: Nihon no bodybuilder tachi) and Otoko: Photo Studies of the Young Japanese Male (\u7537, Otoko). American author Donald Richie gave an eyewitness account of seeing Mishima, dressed in a loincloth and armed with a sword, posing in the snow for one of Tamotsu Yat\u014d's photoshoots.[105]\n\nIn the men's magazine Heibon Punch, to which Mishima had contributed various essays and criticisms, he won first place in the \"Mr. Dandy\" reader popularity poll in 1967 with 19,590 votes, beating second place Toshiro Mifune by 720 votes.[106] In the next reader popularity poll, \"Mr. International\", Mishima ranked second behind French President Charles de Gaulle.[106] At that time in the late 1960s, Mishima was the first celebrity to be described as a \"superstar\" (s\u016bp\u0101sut\u0101) by the Japanese media.[107]\n\nPrivate life [ edit ]\n\nMishima at age 30 in his garden (an autumn day in 1955)\n\nIn 1955, Mishima took up weight training to overcome his weak composition, and his strictly observed workout regimen of three sessions per week was not disrupted for the final 15 years of his life. In his 1968 essay Sun and Steel (\u592a\u967d\u3068\u9244, Taiy\u014d to tetsu),[108] Mishima deplored the emphasis given by intellectuals to the mind over the body. He later became very skilled (5th Dan) at kendo (traditional Japanese swordsmanship), and became 2nd Dan in batt\u014djutsu, and 1st Dan in karate. In 1956, he tried boxing for a short period of time. In the same year, he developed an interest in UFOs and became a member of the Japan Flying Saucer Research Association (\u65e5\u672c\u7a7a\u98db\u3076\u5186\u76e4\u7814\u7a76\u4f1a, Nihon soratobu enban kenkyukai).[109] In 1954, he fell in love with Sadako Toyoda (\u8c4a\u7530\u8c9e\u5b50), who became the model for main characters in The Sunken Waterfall (\u6c88\u3081\u308b\u6edd, Shizumeru taki) and The Seven Bridges (\u6a4b\u3065\u304f\u3057, Hashi zukushi).[110][111] Mishima hoped to marry her, but they broke up in 1957.[60][112]\n\nAfter briefly considering marriage with Michiko Sh\u014dda (\u6b63\u7530\u7f8e\u667a\u5b50), who later married Crown Prince Akihito and became Empress Michiko,[113] Mishima married Y\u014dko (\u7464\u5b50, n\u00e9e Sugiyama), the daughter of Japanese-style painter Yasushi Sugiyama (\u6749\u5c71\u5be7), on 1 June 1958. The couple had two children: a daughter named Noriko (\u7d00\u5b50) (born 2 June 1959) and a son named Iichir\u014d (\u5a01\u4e00\u90ce) (born 2 May 1962).[114] Noriko eventually married the diplomat Koji Tomita (\u51a8\u7530\u6d69\u53f8).[115]\n\nWhile working on his novel Forbidden Colors (\u7981\u8272, Kinjiki), Mishima visited gay bars in Japan.[116] Mishima's sexual orientation was an issue that bothered his wife, and she always denied his homosexuality after his death.[117] In 1998, the writer Jir\u014d Fukushima (\u798f\u5cf6\u6b21\u90ce) published an account of his relationship with Mishima in 1951, including fifteen letters (not love letters) from the famed novelist.[118] Mishima's children successfully sued Fukushima and the publisher for copyright violation over the use of Mishima's letters.[119][118][120] Publisher Bungeishunj\u016b had argued that the contents of the letters were \"practical correspondence\" rather than copyrighted works. However, the ruling for the plaintiffs declared, \"In addition to clerical content, these letters describe the Mishima's own feelings, his aspirations, and his views on life, in different words from those in his literary works.\"[121][h]\n\nIn February 1961, Mishima became embroiled in the aftermath of the Shimanaka incident (\u5d8b\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6, Shimanaka Jiken). In 1960, the author Shichir\u014d Fukazawa (\u6df1\u6ca2\u4e03\u90ce) had published the satirical short story The Tale of an Elegant Dream (\u98a8\u6d41\u5922\u8b5a, F\u016bry\u016b Mutan) in the mainstream magazine Ch\u016b\u014d K\u014dron. It contained a dream sequence (in which the Emperor and Empress are beheaded by a guillotine) that led to outrage from right-wing ultra-nationalist groups, and numerous death threats against Fukazawa, any writers believed to have been associated with him, and Ch\u016b\u014d K\u014dron magazine itself. On 1 February 1961, Kazutaka Komori (\u5c0f\u68ee\u4e00\u5b5d), a seventeen-year-old rightist, broke into the home of H\u014dji Shimanaka (\u5d8b\u4e2d\u9d6c\u4e8c), the president of Ch\u016b\u014d K\u014dron, killed his maid with a knife and severely wounded his wife. In the aftermath, Fukazawa went into hiding, and dozens of writers and literary critics, including Mishima, were provided with round-the-clock police protection for several months; Mishima was included because a rumor that Mishima had personally recommended \"The Tale of an Elegant Dream\" for publication became widespread, and even though he repeatedly denied the claim, he received hundreds of death threats. In later years, Mishima harshly criticized Komori, arguing that those who harm women and children are neither patriots nor traditional right-wingers, and that an assassination attempt should be a one-on-one confrontation with the victim at the risk of the assassin's life. Mishima also argued that it was the custom of traditional Japanese patriots to immediately commit suicide after committing an assassination.[127]\n\nIn 1963, the Harp of Joy Incident occurred within the theatrical troupe Bungakuza (\u6587\u5b66\u5ea7), to which Mishima belonged. He wrote a play titled The Harp of Joy (\u559c\u3073\u306e\u7434, Yorokobi no koto), but star actress Haruko Sugimura (\u6749\u6751\u6625\u5b50) and other Communist Party-affiliated actors refused to perform because the protagonist held anti-communist views and mentioned criticism about a conspiracy of world communism in his lines. As a result of this ideological conflict, Mishima quit Bungakuza and later formed the troupe Neo Litt\u00e9rature Th\u00e9\u00e2tre (\u5287\u56e3NLT, Gekidan NLT) with playwrights and actors who had quit Bungakuza along with him, including Seiichi Yashio (\u77e2\u4ee3\u9759\u4e00), Takeo Matsuura (\u677e\u6d66\u7af9\u592b), and Nobuo Nakamura (\u4e2d\u6751\u4f38\u90ce). When Neo Litt\u00e9rature Th\u00e9\u00e2tre experienced a schism in 1968, Mishima formed another troupe, the Roman Theatre (\u6d6a\u66fc\u5287\u5834, R\u014dman Gekij\u014d), and worked with Matsuura and Nakamura again.[128][129][130]\n\nDuring the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, Mishima interviewed various athletes every day and wrote articles as a newspaper correspondent.[131][132] He had eagerly anticipated the long-awaited return of the Olympics to Japan after the 1940 Tokyo Olympics were cancelled due to Japan's war in China. Mishima expressed his excitement in his report on the opening ceremonies: \"It can be said that ever since Lafcadio Hearn called the Japanese \"the Greeks of the Orient,\" the Olympics were destined to be hosted by Japan someday.\"[133]\n\nMishima hated Ryokichi Minobe, who was a communist and the governor of Tokyo beginning in 1967.[134] Influential persons in the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), including Takeo Fukuda and Kiichi Aichi, had been Mishima's superiors during his time at the Ministry of the Treasury, and Prime Minister Eisaku Sat\u014d came to know Mishima because his wife, Hiroko, was a fan of Mishima's work. Based on these connections LDP officials solicited Mishima to run for the LDP as governor of Tokyo against Minobe, but Mishima had no intention of becoming a politician.[134]\n\nMishima was fond of manga and gekiga, especially the drawing style of Hiroshi Hirata (\u5e73\u7530\u5f18\u53f2), a mangaka best known for his samurai gekiga; the slapstick, absurdist comedy in Fujio Akatsuka's M\u014dretsu Atar\u014d (\u3082\u30fc\u308c\u3064\u30a2\u592a\u90ce), and the imaginativeness of Shigeru Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d (\u30b2\u30b2\u30b2\u306e\u9b3c\u592a\u90ce).[135][136] Mishima especially loved reading the boxing manga Ashita no Joe (\u3042\u3057\u305f\u306e\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc, \"Tomorrow's Joe\") in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine every week.[137][i] Ultraman and Godzilla were his favorite kaiju fantasies, and he once compared himself to \"Godzilla's egg\" in 1955.[138][139] On the other hand, he disliked story manga with humanist or cosmopolitan themes, such as Osamu Tezuka's Phoenix (\u706b\u306e\u9ce5, Hi no tori).[135][136]\n\nMishima was a fan of science fiction, contending that \"science fiction will be the first literature to completely overcome modern humanism\".[140] He praised Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End in particular. While acknowledging \"inexpressible unpleasant and uncomfortable feelings after reading it,\" he declared, \"I'm not afraid to call it a masterpiece.\"[141]\n\nMishima traveled to Shimoda on the Izu Peninsula with his wife and children every summer from 1964 onwards.[142][143] In Shimoda, Mishima often enjoyed eating local seafood with his friend Henry Scott-Stokes.[143] Mishima never showed any hostility towards the US in front of foreign friends like Scott-Stokes, until Mishima heard that the name of the inn where Scott-Stokes was staying was Kurofune ( lit. 'black ship'), at which point his voice suddenly became low and he said in a sullen manner, \"Why? Why do you stay at a place with such a name?\". Mishima liked ordinary American people after the war, and he and his wife had even visited Disneyland as newlyweds.[j] However, he clearly retained a strong sense of hostility toward the \"black ships\" of Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who forcibly opened Japan up to unequal international relations at the end of the Edo period, and had destroyed the peace of Edo, where vivid ch\u014dnin culture was flourishing.[143]\n\nHarmony of Pen and Sword [ edit ]\n\nMishima's nationalism grew towards the end of his life. In 1966, he published his short story The Voices of the Heroic Dead (\u82f1\u970a\u306e\u8072, Eirei no koe), in which he denounced Emperor Hirohito for renouncing his own divinity after World War II. He argued that the soldiers who had died in the February 26 Incident (\u4e8c\u30fb\u4e8c\u516d\u4e8b\u4ef6, Ni-Ni-Roku Jiken) and the Japanese Special Attack Units (\u7279\u653b\u968a, Tokk\u014dtai) had died for their \"living god\" Emperor, and that Hirohito's renunciation of his own divinity meant that all those deaths had been in vain. Mishima said that His Imperial Majesty had become a human when he should be a God.[145][146]\n\nIn February 1967, Mishima joined fellow authors Yasunari Kawabata, K\u014db\u014d Abe, and Jun Ishikawa in issuing a statement condemning China's Cultural Revolution for suppressing academic and artistic freedom.[147][148] However, only one Japanese newspaper carried the full text of their statement.[149]\n\nIn September 1967 Mishima and his wife visited India at the invitation of the Indian government. He traveled widely and met with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and President Zakir Hussain.[150] He left extremely impressed by Indian culture, and what he felt was the Indian people's determination to resist Westernization and protect traditional ways.[151] Mishima feared that his fellow Japanese were too enamored of modernization and western-style materialism to protect traditional Japanese culture.[150] While in New Delhi, he spoke at length with an unnamed colonel in the Indian Army who had experienced skirmishes with Chinese troops on the Sino-Indian border. The colonel warned Mishima of the strength and fighting spirit of the Chinese troops. Mishima later spoke of his sense of danger regarding what he perceived to be a lack of concern in Japan about the need to bolster Japan's national defense against the threat from Communist China.[152][153][k] On his way home from India, Mishima also stopped in Thailand and Laos; his experiences in the three nations became the basis for portions of his novel The Temple of Dawn (\u6681\u306e\u5bfa, Akatsuki no tera), the third in his tetralogy The Sea of Fertility (\u8c4a\u9952\u306e\u6d77, H\u014dj\u014d no Umi).[155]\n\nIn 1968, Mishima wrote a play titled My Friend Hitler (\u308f\u304c\u53cb\u30d2\u30c3\u30c8\u30e9\u30fc, Waga tomo Hittor\u0101), in which he depicted the historical figures of Adolf Hitler, Gustav Krupp, Gregor Strasser, and Ernst R\u00f6hm as mouthpieces to express his own views on fascism and beauty. Mishima explained that after writing the all-female play Madame de Sade, he wanted to write a counterpart play with an all-male cast.[156] Mishima wrote of My Friend Hitler, \"You may read this tragedy as an allegory of the relationship between \u014ckubo Toshimichi and Saig\u014d Takamori\" (two heroes of Japan's Meiji Restoration who initially worked together but later had a falling out).[157]\n\nThat same year, he wrote Life for Sale (\u547d\u58f2\u308a\u307e\u3059, Inochi Urimasu), a humorous story about a man who, after failing to commit suicide, advertises his life for sale.[158] In a review of the English translation, novelist Ian Thomson called it a \"pulp noir\" and a \"sexy, camp delight\", but also noted that, \"beneath the hard-boiled dialogue and the gangster high jinks is a familiar indictment of consumerist Japan and a romantic yearning for the past.\"[159]\n\nMishima was hated by leftists who said Hirohito should have abdicated to take responsibility for the loss of life in the war. They also hated him for his outspoken commitment to bushido, the code of the samurai in The way of the samurai (\u8449\u96a0\u5165\u9580, Hagakure Ny\u016bmon), his support for the abolition of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, and for his contention in his critique The Defense of Culture (\u6587\u5316\u9632\u885b\u8ad6, Bunka B\u014deiron) that preached the importance of the Emperor in Japanese cultures. Mishima regarded the postwar era of Japan, where no poetic culture and supreme artist was born, as an era of fake prosperity, and stated in The Defense of Culture:\n\nIn the postwar prosperity called Sh\u014dwa Genroku, where there are no Chikamatsu Monzaemon, Ihara Saikaku, Matsuo Bash\u014d, only infestation of flashy manners and customs in there. Passion is dried up, strong realism dispels the ground, and the deepening of poetry is neglected. That is, there are no Chikamatsu, Saikaku, or Basho now.[160]\n\nIn other critical essays,[l] Mishima argued that the national spirit which cultivated in Japan's long history is the key to national defense, and he had apprehensions about the insidious \"indirect aggression\" of the Chinese Communist Party, North Korea, and the Soviet Union.[15][16] In critical essays in 1969, Mishima explained Japan's difficult and delicate position and peculiarities between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States.\n\nTo put it simply, support for the Security Treaty means agreeing with the United States, and to oppose it means agreeing with the Soviet Union or the Chinese Communist Party, so after all, it's only just a matter of which foreign country to rely on, and therein the question of \"what is Japan\" is completely lacking. If you ask the Japanese, \"Hey you, do you choose America, Soviet Union, or Chinese Communist Party?\", if he is a true Japanese, he will withhold his attitude.[161][162]\n\nIn regards to those who strongly opposed the US military base in Okinawa and the Security Treaty:\n\nThey may appear to be nationalists and right-wingers in the foreign common sense, but in Japan, most of them are in fact left-wingers and communists.[163][162]\n\nThroughout this period, Mishima continued to work on his magnum opus, The Sea of Fertility tetralogy of novels, which began appearing in a monthly serialized format in September 1965.[164] The four completed novels were Spring Snow (1969), Runaway Horses (1969), The Temple of Dawn (1970), and The Decay of the Angel (published posthumously in 1971). Mishima aimed for a very long novel with a completely different raison d'\u00eatre from Western chronicle novels of the 19th and 20th centuries; rather than telling the story of a single individual or family, Mishima boldly set his goal as interpreting the entire human world.[165] In The Decay of the Angel, four stories convey the transmigration of the human soul as the main character goes through a series of reincarnations.[165] Mishima hoped to express in literary terms something akin to pantheism.[166] Novelist Paul Theroux blurbed the first edition of the English translation of The Sea of Fertility as \"the most complete vision we have of Japan in the twentieth century\" and critic Charles Solomon wrote in 1990 that \"the four novels remain one of the outstanding works of 20th-Century literature and a summary of the author's life and work\".[167]\n\nCoup attempt and ritual suicide [ edit ]\n\nIn August 1966, Mishima visited \u014cmiwa Shrine in Nara Prefecture, thought to be one of the oldest Shint\u014d shrines in Japan, as well as the hometown of his mentor Zenmei Hasuda and the areas associated with the Shinp\u016bren Rebellion (\u795e\u98a8\u9023\u306e\u4e71, Shinp\u016bren no ran), an uprising against the Meiji government by samurai in 1876. This trip would become the inspiration for portions of Runaway Horses (\u5954\u99ac, Honba), the second novel in the Sea of Fertility tetralogy. While in Kumamoto, Mishima purchased a Japanese sword for 100,000 yen. Mishima envisioned the reincarnation of Kiyoaki, the protagonist of the first novel Spring Snow, as a man named Isao who put his life on the line to bring about a restoration of direct rule by the Emperor against the backdrop of the League of Blood Incident (\u8840\u76df\u56e3\u4e8b\u4ef6, Ketsumeidan jiken) in 1932.\n\nFrom 12 April to 27 May 1967, Mishima underwent basic training with the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF).[168] Mishima had originally lobbied to train with the GSDF for six months, but was met with resistance from the Defense Agency.[168] Mishima's training period was finalized to 46 days, which required using some of his connections.[168] His participation in GSDF training was kept secret, both because the Defense Agency did not want to give the impression that anyone was receiving special treatment, and because Mishima wanted to experience \"real\" military life.[168][169] Accordingly, Mishima trained under his birth name, Kimitake Hiraoka, and most of his fellow soldiers did not recognize him.[168]\n\nFrom June 1967, Mishima became a leading figure in a plan to create a 10,000-man \"Japan National Guard\" (\u7956\u56fd\u9632\u885b\u968a, Sokoku B\u014deitai) as a civilian complement to Japan's Self Defense Forces. He began leading groups of right-wing college students to undergo basic training with the GSDF in the hope of training 100 officers to lead the National Guard.[170][171][169]\n\nLike many other right-wingers, Mishima was especially alarmed by the riots and revolutionary actions undertaken by radical \"New Left\" university students, who took over dozens of college campuses in Japan in 1968 and 1969. On 26 February 1968, the 32nd anniversary of the February 26 Incident, he and several other right-wingers met at the editorial offices of the recently founded right-wing magazine Controversy Journal (\u8ad6\u4e89\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb, Rons\u014d jaanaru), where they pricked their little fingers and signed a blood oath promising to die if necessary to prevent a left-wing revolution from occurring in Japan.[172][173] Mishima showed his sincerity by signing his birth name, Kimitake Hiraoka, in his own blood.[172][173]\n\nWhen Mishima found that his plan for a large-scale Japan National Guard with broad public and private support failed to catch on,[174] he formed the Tatenokai (\u696f\u306e\u4f1a, \"Shield Society\") on 5 October 1968, a private militia composed primarily of right-wing college students who swore to protect the Emperor of Japan. The activities of the Tatenokai primarily focused on martial training and physical fitness, including traditional kendo sword-fighting and long-distance running.[175][176] Mishima personally oversaw this training. Initial membership was around 50, and was drawn primarily from students from Waseda University and individuals affiliated with Controversy Journal. The number of Tatenokai members later increased to 100.[177][170] Some of the members had graduated from university and were employed, while some were already working adults when they enlisted.[178]\n\nMishima delivering his speech on the balcony\n\nOn 25 November 1970, Mishima and four members of the Tatenokai\u2014Masakatsu Morita (\u68ee\u7530\u5fc5\u52dd), Masahiro Ogawa (\u5c0f\u5ddd\u6b63\u6d0b), Masayoshi Koga (\u5c0f\u8cc0\u6b63\u7fa9), and Hiroyasu Koga (\u53e4\u8cc0\u6d69\u9756)\u2014used a pretext to visit the commandant Kanetoshi Mashita (\u76ca\u7530\u517c\u5229) of Camp Ichigaya, a military base in central Tokyo and the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[117] Inside, they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair. Mishima wore a white hachimaki headband with a red hinomaru circle in the center bearing the kanji for \"To be reborn seven times to serve the country\" (\u4e03\u751f\u5831\u570b, Shichish\u014d h\u014dkoku), which was a reference to the last words of Kusunoki Masasue, the younger brother of the 14th century imperial loyalist samurai Kusunoki Masashige (\u6960\u6728\u6b63\u6210), as the two brothers died fighting to defend the Emperor.[179] With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped out onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'\u00e9tat to restore the power of the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was heckled, with jeers and the noise of helicopters drowning out some parts of his speech. In his speech Mishima rebuked the JSDF for their passive acceptance of a constitution that \"denies (their) own existence\" and shouted to rouse them, \"Where has the spirit of the samurai gone?\" In his final written appeal that Morita and Ogawa scattered copies of from the balcony, Mishima expressed his dissatisfaction with the half-baked nature of the JSDF:\n\nIt is self-evident that the United States would not be pleased with a true Japanese volunteer army protecting the land of Japan.[180][181]\n\nAfter he finished reading his prepared speech in a few minutes' time, Mishima cried out \"Long live the Emperor!\" (\u5929\u7687\u965b\u4e0b\u4e07\u6b73, Tenno-heika banzai) three times. He then retreated into the commandant's office and apologized to the commandant, saying,\n\n\"We did it to return the JSDF to the Emperor. I had no choice but to do this.\"[184]\n\nMishima then committed seppuku, a form of ritual suicide by disembowelment associated with the samurai. Morita had been assigned to serve as Mishima's second (kaishakunin), cutting off his head with a sword at the end of the ritual to spare him unnecessary pain. However, Morita proved unable to complete his task, and after three failed attempts to sever Mishima's head, Koga had to step in and complete the task.[184]\n\nAccording to the testimony of the surviving coup members, originally all four Tatenokai members had planned to commit seppuku along with Mishima. However Mishima attempted to dissuade them and three of the members acquiesced to his wishes. Only Morita persisted, saying, \"I can't let Mr. Mishima die alone.\" But Mishima knew that Morita had a girlfriend and still hoped he might live. Just before his seppuku, Mishima tried one more time to dissuade him, saying \"Morita, you must live, not die.\"[185][186][m] Nevertheless, after Mishima's seppuku, Morita knelt and stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga acted as kaishakunin again.[187]\n\nThis coup attempt is called The Mishima Incident (\u4e09\u5cf6\u4e8b\u4ef6, Mishima jiken) in Japan.[n]\n\nAnother traditional element of the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems by the Tatenokai members before their entry into the headquarters.[189] Having been enlisted in the Ground Self-Defense Force for about four years, Mishima and other Tatenokai members, alongside several officials, were secretly researching coup plans for a constitutional amendment. They thought there was a chance when security dispatch (\u6cbb\u5b89\u51fa\u52d5, Chian Shutsudo) was dispatched to subjugate the Zenkyoto revolt. However, Zenkyoto was suppressed easily by the Riot Police Unit in October 1969. These officials gave up the coup of constitutional amendment, and Mishima was disappointed in them and the actual circumstances in Japan after World War II.[190] Officer Kiyokatsu Yamamoto (\u5c71\u672c\u821c\u52dd), Mishima's training teacher, explained further:\n\nThe officers had a trusty connection with the U.S.A.F. (includes U.S.F.J), and with the approval of the U.S. army side, they were supposed to carry out a security dispatch toward the Armed Forces of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. However, due to the policy change (reversal) of U.S. by Henry Kissinger who prepared for visiting China in secret (changing relations between U.S. and China), it became a situation where the Japanese military was not allowed legally.[190]\n\nMishima planned his suicide meticulously for at least a year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members knew what he was planning.[191][192] His biographer, translator John Nathan, suggests that the coup attempt was only a pretext for the ritual suicide of which Mishima had long dreamed.[193] His friend Scott-Stokes, another biographer, says that \"Mishima is the most important person in postwar Japan\", and described the shackles of the constitution of Japan:\n\nMishima cautioned against the lack of reality in the basic political controversy in Japan and the particularity of Japan's democratic principles.[194]\n\nScott-Stokes noted a meeting with Mishima in his diary entry for 3 September 1970, at which Mishima, with a dark expression on his face, said:\n\nJapan lost its spiritual tradition, and materialism infested instead. Japan is under the curse of a Green Snake now. The Green Snake bites on Japanese chest. There is no way to escape this curse.[195]\n\nScott-Stokes told Takao Tokuoka in 1990 that he took the Green Snake to mean the U.S. dollar.[196] Between 1968 and 1970, Mishima also said words about Japan's future. Mishima's senior friend and father heard from Mishima:\n\nJapan will be hit hard. One day, the United States suddenly contacts China over Japan's head, Japan will only be able to look up from the bottom of the valley and eavesdrop on the conversation slightly. Our friend Taiwan will say that \"it will no longer be able to count on Japan\", and Taiwan will go somewhere. Japan may become an orphan in the Orient, and may eventually fall into the product of slave dealers.[197]\n\nMishima's corpse was returned home the day after his death. His father Azusa had been afraid to see his son whose appearance had completely changed. However, when he looked into the casket fearfully, Mishima's head and body had been sutured neatly, and his dead face, to which makeup had been beautifully applied, looked as if he were alive due to the police officers. They said: \"We applied funeral makeup carefully with special feelings, because it is the body of Dr. Mishima, whom we have always respected secretly.\"[198] Mishima's body was dressed in the Tatenokai uniform, and the gunt\u014d was firmly clasped at the chest according to the will that Mishima entrusted to his friend Kinemaro Izawa (\u4f0a\u6ca2\u7532\u5b50\u9ebf).[198][199] Azusa put the manuscript papers and fountain pen that his son cherished in the casket together.[198][o] Mishima had made sure his affairs were in order and left money for the legal defence of the three surviving Tatenokai members\u2014Masahiro Ogawa (\u5c0f\u5ddd\u6b63\u6d0b), Masayoshi Koga (\u5c0f\u8cc0\u6b63\u7fa9), and Hiroyasu Koga.[192][p] After the incident, there were exaggerated media commentaries that \"it was a fear of the revival of militarism\".[196] The commandant who was made a hostage said in the trial,\n\nI didn't feel hate towards the defendants at that time. Thinking about the country of Japan, thinking about the JSDF, the pure hearts of thinking about our country that did that kind of thing, I want to buy it as an individual.\n\nThe day of the Mishima Incident (25 November) was the date when Hirohito (Emperor Sh\u014dwa) became regent and the Emperor Sh\u014dwa made the Humanity Declaration at the age of 45. Researchers believe that Mishima chose that day to revive the \"God\" by dying as a scapegoat, at the same age as when the Emperor became a human.[204][205] There are also views that the day corresponds to the date of execution (after the adoption of the Gregorian calendar) of Yoshida Sh\u014din (\u5409\u7530\u677e\u9670), whom Mishima respected,[198] or that Mishima had set his period of bardo (\u4e2d\u6709, Chuu) for reincarnation because the 49th day after his death was his birthday, 14 January.[206] On his birthday, Mishima's remains were buried in the grave of the Hiraoka Family at Tama Cemetery.[198] In addition, 25 November is the day he began writing Confessions of a Mask (\u4eee\u9762\u306e\u544a\u767d, Kamen no kokuhaku), and this work was announced as \"Techniques of Life Recovery\", \"Suicide inside out\". Mishima also wrote down in notes for this work,\n\nThis book is a will for leave in the Realm of Death where I used to live. If you take a movie of a suicide jumped, and rotate the film in reverse, the suicide person jumps up from the valley bottom to the top of the cliff at a furious speed and he revives.[207][208]\n\nWriter Takashi Inoue believes he wrote Confessions of a Mask to live in postwar Japan, and to get away from his \"Realm of Death\"; by dying on the same date that he began to write Confessions of a Mask, Mishima intended to dismantle all of his postwar creative activities and return to the \"Realm of Death\" where he used to live.[208]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nMishima Yukio Literary Museum in Yamanakako, Yamanashi\n\nMuch speculation has surrounded Mishima's suicide. At the time of his death he had just completed the final book in his Sea of Fertility tetralogy.[117] He was recognized as one of the most important post-war stylists of the Japanese language. Mishima wrote 34 novels, about 50 plays, about 25 books of short stories, at least 35 books of essays, one libretto, and one film.[209]\n\nGrave of Yukio Mishima in Tama Cemetery. The inscription reads, \"Grave of Hiraoka family\".\n\nMishima's grave is located at the Tama Cemetery in Fuch\u016b, Tokyo. The Mishima Prize was established in 1988 to honor his life and works. On 3 July 1999, \"Yukio Mishima Literary Museum\" (\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u6587\u5b66\u9928, Mishima Yukio Bungaku-kan) was opened in Yamanakako, Yamanashi Prefecture.[210]\n\nThe Mishima Incident helped inspire the formation of New Right (\u65b0\u53f3\u7ffc, shin uyoku) groups in Japan, such as the \"Issuikai\" (\u4e00\u6c34\u4f1a), founded by Tsutomu Abe (\u963f\u90e8\u52c9), who was Mishima's follower. Compared to older groups such as Bin Akao's Greater Japan Patriotic Party that took a pro-American, anti-communist stance, New Right groups such as the Issuikai tended to emphasize ethnic nationalism and anti-Americanism.[211]\n\nA memorial service deathday for Mishima, called \"Patriotism Memorial\" (\u6182\u56fd\u5fcc, Y\u016bkoku-ki), is held every year in Japan on 25 November by the \"Yukio Mishima Study Group\" (\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u7814\u7a76\u4f1a, Mishima Yukio Kenky\u016bkai) and former members of the \"Japan Student Alliance\" (\u65e5\u672c\u5b66\u751f\u540c\u76df, Nihon Gakusei D\u014dmei).[212] Apart from this, a memorial service is held every year by former Tatenokai members, which began in 1975, the year after Masahiro Ogawa, Masayoshi Koga, and Hiroyasu Koga were released on parole.[213]\n\nA variety of cenotaphs and memorial stones have been erected in honor of Mishima's memory in various places around Japan. For example, stones have been erected at Hachiman Shrine in Kakogawa City, Hyogo Prefecture, where his grandfather's permanent domicile was;[214] in front of the 2nd company corps at JGSDF Camp Takigahara;[215] and in one of Mishima's acquaintance's home garden.[216] There is also a \"Monument of Honor Yukio Mishima & Masakatsu Morita\" in front of the Rissho University Shonan High school in Shimane Prefecture.[217]\n\nThe Mishima Yukio Shrine was built in the suburb of Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, on 9 January 1983.[218][219]\n\nA 1985 biographical film by Paul Schrader titled Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters depicts his life and work; however, it has never been given a theatrical presentation in Japan. A 2012 Japanese film titled 11:25 The Day He Chose His Own Fate also looks at Mishima's last day. The 1983 gay pornographic film Beautiful Mystery satirised the homosexual undertones of Mishima's career.[220][12]\n\nIn 2014, Mishima was one of the inaugural honourees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighbourhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\".[221][222][223]\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nMajor works [ edit ]\n\nLiterature [ edit ]\n\nCritical essay [ edit ]\n\nPlays for classical Japanese theatre [ edit ]\n\nIn addition to contemporary-style plays such as Madame de Sade, Mishima wrote for two of the three genres of classical Japanese theatre: Noh and Kabuki (as a proud Tokyoite, he would not even attend the Bunraku puppet theatre, always associated with Osaka and the provinces).[230]\n\nThough Mishima took themes, titles and characters from the Noh canon, his twists and modern settings, such as hospitals and ballrooms, startled audiences accustomed to the long-settled originals.\n\nDonald Keene translated Kindai Nogaku-sh\u016b (\u8fd1\u4ee3\u80fd\u697d\u96c6, Five Modern Noh Plays) (Tuttle, 1981; ISBN 0-8048-1380-9).

Patriotism was written and funded by himself, and he directed it in close cooperation with Masaki Domoto. Mishima also wrote a detailed account of the whole process, in which the particulars regarding costume, shooting expenses and the film's reception are delved into.

During World War II, having failed to qualify physically for military service, he worked in a Tokyo factory, and after the war he studied law at the University of Tokyo. In 1948\u201349 he worked in the banking division of the Japanese Ministry of Finance. His first novel, Kamen no kokuhaku (1949; Confessions of a Mask), is a partly autobiographical work that describes with exceptional stylistic brilliance a homosexual who must mask his sexual preferences from the society around him. The novel gained Mishima immediate acclaim, and he began to devote his full energies to writing.\n\nHe followed up his initial success with several novels whose main characters are tormented by various physical or psychological problems or who are obsessed with unattainable ideals that make everyday happiness impossible for them. Among these works are Ai no kawaki (1950; Thirst for Love), Kinjiki (1954; Forbidden Colours), and Shiosai (1954; The Sound of Waves). Kinkaku-ji (1956; The Temple of the Golden Pavilion) is the story of a troubled young acolyte at a Buddhist temple who burns down the famous building because he himself cannot attain to its beauty. Utage no ato (1960; After the Banquet) explores the twin themes of middle-aged love and corruption in Japanese politics. In addition to novels, short stories, and essays, Mishima also wrote plays in the form of the Japanese N\u014d drama, producing reworked and modernized versions of the traditional stories. His plays include Sado k\u014dshaku fujin (1965; Madame de Sade) and Kindai n\u014dgaku shu (1956; Five Modern N\u014dh Plays).\n\nMishima\u2019s last work, H\u014dj\u014d no umi (1965\u201370; The Sea of Fertility), is a four-volume epic that is regarded by many as his most lasting achievement. Its four separate novels\u2014Haru no yuki (Spring Snow), Homma (Runaway Horses), Akatsuki no tera (The Temple of Dawn), and Tennin gosui (The Decay of the Angel)\u2014are set in Japan and cover the period from about 1912 to the 1960s. Each of them depicts a different reincarnation of the same being: as a young aristocrat in 1912, as a political fanatic in the 1930s, as a Thai princess before and after World War II, and as an evil young orphan in the 1960s. These books effectively communicate Mishima\u2019s own increasing obsession with blood, death, and suicide, his interest in self-destructive personalities, and his rejection of the sterility of modern life.\n\nMishima\u2019s novels are typically Japanese in their sensuous and imaginative appreciation of natural detail, but their solid and competent plots, their probing psychological analysis, and a certain understated humour helped make them widely read in other countries.\n\nThe short story \u201cYukoku\u201d (\u201cPatriotism\u201d) from the collection Death in Midsummer, and Other Stories (1966) revealed Mishima\u2019s own political views and proved prophetic of his own end. The story describes, with obvious admiration, a young army officer who commits seppuku, or ritual disembowelment, to demonstrate his loyalty to the Japanese emperor. Mishima was deeply attracted to the austere patriotism and martial spirit of Japan\u2019s past, which he contrasted unfavourably to the materialistic Westernized people and the prosperous society of Japan in the postwar era. Mishima himself was torn between these differing values. Although he maintained an essentially Western lifestyle in his private life and had a vast knowledge of Western culture, he raged against Japan\u2019s imitation of the West. He diligently developed the age-old Japanese arts of karate and kendo and formed a controversial private army of about 80 students, the Tate no Kai (Shield Society), with the aim of preserving the Japanese martial spirit and helping to protect the emperor (the symbol of Japanese culture) in case of an uprising by the left or a communist attack.\n\nAre you a student?

He gave a 10-minute speech from a balcony to a thousand assembled servicemen in which he urged them to overthrow Japan\u2019s post-World War II constitution, which forbids war and Japanese rearmament. The soldiers\u2019 response was unsympathetic, and Mishima then committed seppuku in the traditional manner, disemboweling himself with his sword, followed by decapitation at the hands of a follower. This shocking event aroused much speculation as to Mishima\u2019s motives as well as regret that his death had robbed the world of such a gifted writer."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_37504c1d-2175-4867-a0e6-3b8f9053c63d"}

The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman art and literature during the Renaissance played a significant role in this development [2]. The humanist movement, which emphasized human experience and individuality, led to a renewed interest in realistic representations of the human figure, spatial depth in paintings, and accurate portrayals of nature [3]. Additionally, the rise of patronage in the arts by wealthy individuals, religious institutions, and political entities encouraged exploration of new artistic techniques and subjects [4]. Artists began to experiment with new materials, such as oil paint and canvas, which allowed them to achieve greater detail and realism in their works [5]. The creation of linear perspective, attributed to the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, transformed the way artists depicted space and depth in their paintings [6]. Another factor in the appearance of naturalism and realistic notions in European art was the growth of scientific inquiry and empirical observation[7]. The development of artists' workshops and academies that emphasized a systematic study of anatomy, light, and perspective contributed to the advancement of naturalistic techniques [8]. Moreover, the increased exchange of ideas and artistic practices between European countries helped to create a network of artistic knowledge and skills, further facilitating the development of realistic art [9].

The basic principles of surface analysis include surface-sensitive analytical methods, which rely on the interaction of a probe (such as photons, electrons, or ions) with the surface of the material [2].

Surface contamination: The presence of contaminants, such as hydrocarbons and residual gases, on the surface of the material can affect the accuracy and reliability of the analysis[5].

It had relatively humble beginnings as a nation-state early in the second millennium B.C.E. Its status underwent many changes; though sometimes it was an independent state, it also fell to the Babylonian Empire, and later to Mittani rule. But unlike other nation-states, because of their technological advances in warfare, the Assyrians maintained their land while other states and empires rose and fell from power. When another group, the Hittites, rose to power and overthrew Mittani rule, it left a power vacuum that sent the region into war and chaos. This left the Assyrians poised to gain more power in the region. Around 900 B.C.E., a new series of Assyrian kings, beginning with Adad Nirari II, rose to prominence and expanded Assyria\u2019s borders into a huge empire.\n\nAdad Nirari II and his successors used new warfare techniques to take over enemy cities one by one. The Assyrians had several advantages that they had been developing for generations while other empires came and went. They were the first in the area to develop iron weapons, which were superior to the bronze weapons their enemies were using. Their skill at ironworking allowed them to make weapons and protective items more cheaply, so more soldiers could use them. In addition, they were the first army to have a separate engineering unit, which would set up ladders and ramps, fill in moats, and dig tunnels to help the soldiers get into a walled city. They were also among the first to build chariots, which provided greater protection on the battlefield. These technological advancements allowed the Assyrians to go on the offensive and attack neighboring areas for the first time, which led to the expansion of their empire .\n\nThe Assyrian Empire maintained power for hundreds of years. But in the 600s B.C.E., the empire became too large to maintain, and it fell apart. Even after its fall, the empire\u2019s legacy lived on in the warfare tactics and technologies that were adopted by later civilizations.", "In his new book \u201cAssyria: The Rise and Fall of the World\u2019s First Empire\u201d (Basic Books), Yale professor Eckart Frahm offers a comprehensive history of the ancient civilization (circa 2025 BCE to 609 BCE) that would become a model for the world\u2019s later empires.\n\nEmerging from the city-state of Ashur, located in modern-day Iraq, Assyria undertook numerous often-violent military campaigns to spread its rule into Babylonia and other regions; but its kings also created a transportation network that made possible the free flow of ideas and goods and established the first universal library, says Frahm, a professor of Assyriology in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations in Yale\u2019s Faculty of Arts & Sciences.\n\nFor the book, Frahm draws on finds from recent archaeological excavations, cuneiform tablets, and Biblical and classical texts to describe what is known about life in the empire \u2014 for royal and non-royal Assyrians alike \u2014 and the circumstances that contributed to its hasty demise.\n\nIn an interview with Yale News, Frahm discusses what inspired his own interest in this ancient Mesopotamian empire, what we know about its people, and why its epic rise and fall should still matter to modern readers. The interview is edited and condensed.\n\nHow did you become interested in Assyria as a scholarly topic?\n\nEckart Frahm: I first became interested in Mesopotamia when I was in high school. I took some Hebrew, simply because I wanted to learn a language that was different, and I began to realize that there was a whole world beyond the biblical narrative. The history of Mesopotamian civilization encompasses 3,500 years, of which Assyrian history is an important portion.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to paint a very detailed, often exciting, and occasionally entertaining picture of Assyrian history. Eckart Frahm\n\nLater, I had a number of university teachers who were specialists in the linguistic study of Assyrian and who had edited a variety of Assyrian texts. I did my fair share of editorial work myself, but thought at some point I might move beyond philology to instead bring together the many different sources about Assyrian history.\n\nThere are literally tens and tens of thousands of Assyrian cuneiform texts, from royal inscriptions in which kings describe their military activities or building projects, to letters to royalty by officials or by spies that talk about the military and political challenges the empire experienced. It\u2019s possible to paint a very detailed, often exciting, and occasionally entertaining picture of Assyrian history.\n\nWhat is the legacy of the Assyrian Empire?\n\nFrahm: Assyria\u2019s most important legacy is probably the idea of empire as such. \u201cEmpires\u201d have a bad name today, and I have no interest in downplaying their dark sides. Fundamentally, \u201cempire\u201d means that there is some center that rules over a large and somewhat diverse periphery, which is to a significant extent unfree. Empire, however, also offers some advantages, including, for example, greater ease of flow of ideas and of merchandise.\n\nIndeed, the Assyrians started off primarily as merchants. When they operated their city-state in the early second millennium BCE, long before the imperial period, it was territorially a very small entity. But the geographic horizon of the Assyrian people of this time was already broad: they were engaged in long-distance trade, importing tin from Central Asia and textiles from Babylonia, and trading both for silver in Anatolia.\n\nLater on, during the so-called Neo-Assyrian period [ca. 900 BCE to 600 BCE], the Assyrians created a very sophisticated communication network. The so-called Royal Road is often associated with the Persian Empire, which started off in 539 BCE, but it existed already in Assyrian times.\n\nI think it is important to stress that, unlike later empires, the Assyrians were not trying to impose their own culture, their own language, or their own religion on any of their subjects. People in the imperial periphery had to pay taxes to the crown and supply labor, but they were allowed and expected to just continue worshiping their own gods and speaking their own languages. In this regard you could say the Assyrians were not super-repressive.\n\nWhat is known about the everyday lives of non-royal Assyrians?\n\nFrahm: A great deal is known, particularly about those living in cities, but also about the rural population, which engaged in agriculture, with barley as their main crop. Most of the people in the countryside were probably semi-free. Those who grew crops could keep a share. Another share went to the state, and sometimes a share went to landowners, many of them members of the military.\n\nThere were also shepherds on the steppe, herding flocks of sheep and goats. A cuneiform letter reveals that, for some seven years, some of these shepherds failed to send a portion of their flocks to the Ashur Temple in Ashur. This draws a complaint from an official of the temple, who tells the king, \u201cIf you don\u2019t do anything about that, then your authority is in peril.\u201d The episode shows us that even though the Assyrian kings were very powerful, they couldn\u2019t fully be in charge of everything.\n\nWe also know a lot about how husbands and wives interacted, sometimes apparently not harmoniously. Cuneiform texts talk about husbands and wives having fantasies of killing their spouses and marrying someone else and so on. But there are also stories of great affection, and of grief when a beloved child would die.\n\nFamilies were essentially, like today, monogamous, with a few children living with their parents in a house, sometimes grandparents as well. The dead would be buried literally under their feet in vaults under the houses. Families would go down there to make sacrifices for the dead on holidays and other special occasions. People also had pets. Some texts include cat omens, which predict what happens when a cat sits on a person\u2019s breast or urinates on that person. The latter was considered a good sign, indicating that the individual in question would become wealthy.\n\nThe fall of the Assyrian empire happened quickly. What caused it?\n\nFrahm: That\u2019s a million-dollar question, and the answer is still not entirely clear. Two recent theories have tried to pinpoint forces greater than politics; on the one hand climate change, and on the other migration. I\u2019m not entirely sure, though, that these factors were absolutely decisive.\n\nIn my view, it was a perfect storm that brought the empire down. One issue was that during the empire\u2019s last decades, the Assyrian crown experienced a crisis of legitimacy. It had been precipitated by Ashurbanipal, whose long reign [669-631 BCE] marked a cultural high point for Assyria \u2014 he created the first universal library and is also famous for the sculpted reliefs that lined the walls of his palaces. But Ashurbanipal didn\u2019t live up to the image he tried to project; he wanted to be perceived as a great warrior, for instance, but never went to war. Instead, he stayed home in his palace, where, according to his own texts and later tradition, \u201che ate, drank, and made merry.\u201d\n\nThis, I think, already sowed some doubt among his subjects about the fitness of their imperial rulers. Then Ashurbanipal dies, and a lot of internal and external strife follows. There\u2019s a rebellion in the south by Babylonians, who actually manage to chase the Assyrians out of Babylonia. At the same time, territories in the Levant, in the west, regain their independence. And in the east, the Medes, united in response to the pressure previously put on them by the Assyrians, join the Babylonians in the fight against the empire.\n\nIn 615 BCE, the Medes and the Babylonians embark on a last attack on Assyria. It\u2019s the first time in hundreds of years that Assyrian cities are under siege. For a while the Assyrians have some allies, including, unexpectedly, the Egyptians. The conflict escalates into what one could describe as a first \u201cworld war,\u201d with a cataclysmic series of battles eventually leading to Assyria\u2019s collapse.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nFrahm: The Assyrian cities prove to be not very easy to defend. For example, Nineveh \u2014 the greatest of all the Assyrian cities and the capital at the time \u2014 was built with 18 gigantic gates. This was a strategic liability: the gates were so large that they provided little protection against enemy attacks. Archaeologists actually found the bodies of Assyrian soldiers killed in these very gates when the Medes and the Babylonians in 612 BCE got through. Two years earlier, in 614 BCE, the Medes had already conquered the city of Ashur, Assyria\u2019s religious and spiritual center. And with the fall of those cities, and the city of Harran in 609 BCE, comes the fall of the empire and the royal dynasty.\n\nWhy is Assyria important today?\n\nFrahm: One reason is that \u201cempire\u201d is still with us today. The empires of today no longer call themselves empires. But imperial ideologies, of course, are still very much in place. So I think Assyria can be said to mark the very beginning of a chain that runs from the first millennium BCE to the modern age.\n\nI think Assyria can be said to mark the very beginning of a chain that runs from the first millennium BCE to the modern age. Eckart Frahm\n\nIn the Middle East, the Assyrian Empire was followed by others, from the Persian up to the Ottoman Empire. Although empire is a shape-shifting phenomenon, all these geopolitical entities were essentially based on a blueprint that the Assyrians were the first to create.\n\nAssyria also teaches us something about how wrong it is to \u201cessentialize\u201d the people of the Middle East. I think it\u2019s really interesting to see how Assyria starts off not as a war-prone state but as a pretty peaceful one, with a mixed constitution in place and even some democratic institutions. Later, it becomes much more belligerent and autocratic. When you look at that story, you can see that the peoples of the Middle East can change, and that people in general can change \u2014 that social and political change is possible.\n\nFinally, as we are coming out of several years of plague with the COVID crisis, it\u2019s interesting to consider what kind of impact epidemics had in ancient Assyria. In the book I argue that, surprisingly, the rise of the Assyrian empire, rather than its fall, is connected to plague. It was in the wake of two bouts of contagious disease \u2014 and the economic and demographic contraction caused by them \u2014 that the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III [744\u2013727 BCE] embarked on a series of conquests and annexations at the end of which the Assyrian state was more than twice as large as it had been before.\n\nSo the great mystery then, is how can it be that the phoenix of empire rises from the ashes of several grim years of plague? I would argue that history is not something predetermined by deterministic rules. If challenges are not too massive, then humans can actually adapt to them and find ways to get out of a crisis. This is what Tiglath-pileser did when he compensated for the loss of life and wealth Assyria had suffered by implementing a new grand strategy focused on annexing foreign lands, extracting their assets for the greater good of the Assyrian center, and deporting hundreds of thousands of people to replenish the work force where it was most urgently needed.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t a story for us to emulate. Rather, I think of it as a warning that bad actors may well take advantage of the natural disasters that tend to befall humanity and have befallen us, of course, in recent years with COVID. And we better be aware and be on the lookout for what others may do in such circumstances. Assyria teaches us that there are all sorts of ways to react to historical challenges."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_01bf0260-c739-4eba-b94c-0c9f1a8f3b6b"}

The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman art and literature during the Renaissance played a significant role in this development [2]. The humanist movement, which emphasized human experience and individuality, led to a renewed interest in realistic representations of the human figure, spatial depth in paintings, and accurate portrayals of nature [3]. Additionally, the rise of patronage in the arts by wealthy individuals, religious institutions, and political entities encouraged exploration of new artistic techniques and subjects [4]. Artists began to experiment with new materials, such as oil paint and canvas, which allowed them to achieve greater detail and realism in their works [5]. The creation of linear perspective, attributed to the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, transformed the way artists depicted space and depth in their paintings [6]. Another factor in the appearance of naturalism and realistic notions in European art was the growth of scientific inquiry and empirical observation[7]. The development of artists' workshops and academies that emphasized a systematic study of anatomy, light, and perspective contributed to the advancement of naturalistic techniques [8]. Moreover, the increased exchange of ideas and artistic practices between European countries helped to create a network of artistic knowledge and skills, further facilitating the development of realistic art [9].

S. law of inheritance, stops a person inheriting property from a person they murdered (so that, for example, a murderer cannot inherit from parents or a spouse they killed).\n\nWhile a criminal conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the slayer rule applies to civil law, not criminal law, so the petitioner must only prove the murder by a preponderance of the evidence, as in a wrongful death claim meaning on the civil standard of proof of the balance of probability. Hence, even a slayer who is acquitted of the crime of murder can lose the inheritance by the civil court running the estate.\n\nSo far, 47 states have codified the slayer statute, either by adopting the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) or a version of the code that includes the slayer statute.\n\nStatutory response to slayers [ edit ]\n\nAt common law, American courts used two different theories when dealing with early slayer cases. Some courts would disinherit the slayer because of the public policy principle that a slayer should not profit from his crime (No Profit theory).[1]\n\nNo Profit theory [ edit ]\n\nIn Mutual Life v. Armstrong (1886), the first American case to consider the issue of whether a slayer could profit from their crime, the US Supreme Court set forth the No Profit theory (the term \"No Profit\" was coined by legal scholar Adam D. Hansen in an effort to distinguish early common law cases that applied a similar outcome when dealing with slayers).[1] public policy justification of slayer statutes saying: \"It would be a reproach to the jurisprudence of the country if one could recover insurance money payable on the death of the party whose life he had feloniously taken.\"[2]\n\nOther courts were reluctant to disinherit a slayer in absence of a legislatively codified statute directing the court to do so (Strict Construction theory).[1]\n\nStrict Construction theory [ edit ]\n\nThe Strict Construction theory (the term \"Strict Construction\" was coined by legal scholar Adam D. Hansen in an effort to distinguish early common law cases that dealt applied a similar outcome when disinheriting slayers).[1] originated from Judge John Clinton Gray's dissent in Riggs v. Palmer (1889).[3] Judge Gray argued that the criminal law already established punishment for slayers. A court denying the estate to a slayer was to, in effect, add significant further punishment to what a slayer received under the criminal statute. Judge Gray argued that this was not something the court was permitted to do without an express, written statute. In Judge Gray's opinion, the court could not simply create or imagine such statutes so as to obtain a morally pleasing result.\n\nSlayer statutes codify the public policy principle that a murderer cannot profit from his crime. Slayer statutes provide a right of civil action to a victim's successors for the purpose of directing the victim's testate/intestate property away from the slayer. Such an action is brought by a successor, or other party of interest (e.g., life insurance company, bank), on behalf of the victim's estate. The slayer statute applies to both real and personal property that would have been acquired by intestacy or by will.[4]\n\nIn 1936, legal scholar John W. Wade proposed a No Profit theory statutory fix to promote uniformity amongst the states in dealing with slayer cases.[5] In 1969, the Uniform Law Commission included No Profit theory language in its first promulgation of the Uniform Probate Code (UPC).[6] Forty-eight states have enacted laws that strip a slayer of any inheritance benefit he would have gained from his unlawful act.[7]\n\nRegional details [ edit ]\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States, most jurisdictions have enacted a slayer statute,[8] which codifies the rule and supplies additional conditions. Such laws have sometimes been construed narrowly because the relevant statutes are criminal in nature, and serve to take away someone's rights that are otherwise afforded by law. Interpreted this way, a slayer statute will not prevent the killer from acquiring title to the property by other means. In jurisdictions with a common law slayer rule, a slayer statute may serve to extend and supplement the common law rule, rather than limiting it. For example, where the statute requires the heir to have been convicted to bar inheritance, a common law slayer rule that does not have this requirement may still serve to bar inheritance.[9]\n\nArizona [ edit ]\n\nIn 2012, the Arizona legislature amended Arizona's slayer rule to include the lesser crime of manslaughter in an effort to subject more killers to civil disinheritance.[1] Prior to the 2012 amendment, only killers found guilty of murder in the first or second degree would be disinherited under Arizona's slayer rule. Several specific cases (e.g., Grace Pianka;[10] Douglas Grant;[11][12][13] and Gilbert Ramos)[14] prompted the Arizona legislature to amend Arizona's slayer rule by 1) expressly defining \u201cintentional and felonious\u201d to mean any individual who is found guilty of murder in the first or second degree, or the lesser crime of manslaughter; 2) allowing victims to place the decedent's estate in constructive trust immediately from the time of the killing; and 3) allowing the victims to place the slayer's estate (i.e., life insurance benefits) in constructive trust, in the case of murder-suicide. Arizona now touts its slayer rule as the strongest in the nation.\n\nIllinois [ edit ]\n\nA person found guilty of financial exploitation, abuse or neglect cannot inherit any benefit from their victim.[15]\n\nKansas [ edit ]\n\nKansas prohibits a slayer's inheritance where suicide is shortly after the murder.[16]\n\nMaryland [ edit ]\n\nThe Maryland slayer rule is harsher than most other states. In addition to prohibiting murderers from inheriting from their victims, Maryland's slayer rule prohibits anyone else from inheriting from murder victims through their murderers; Maryland's slayer rule is thus similar in structure to corruption of blood.[17]\n\nFor example, a mother leaves her son $50,000, and leaves her son's child (her grandchild) $100,000. She leaves her residuary estate (i.e., whatever else is left of the estate) to her daughter. If the son kills his mother, then under Maryland law, the son's child will inherit the $100,000; however the son's $50,000 (which is also the indirect inheritance of the grandchild through his father), is not available under Maryland law to either the son, or his child. The $50,000 becomes part of the mother's residuary estate and goes to the daughter.\n\nMissouri [ edit ]\n\nThe Missouri slayer rule only exists in common law. It has not been codified. There has not been a proposed slayer statute by the legislature in recent years. The Missouri Supreme Court found a slayer statute to be unnecessary in Lee v.

Observations of the CMB, particularly from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite, have measured the temperature fluctuations at different angular scales corresponding to different cosmic densities, revealing a clear peak at around 1-degree angular scale  [2]. This peak in the CMB temperature fluctuations, known as the first acoustic peak, indicates the presence of a significant amount of non-baryonic (dark) matter, which does not interact with radiation [3]. Baryonic matter alone cannot account for the amplitude observed in the first acoustic peak, meaning that there must be another form of matter involved in the formation of structures in the universe [4]. Dark matter, unlike baryonic matter, does not emit, absorb, or scatter electromagnetic radiation, and it influences the growth of density fluctuations primarily through its gravitational effects on the baryonic matter and the expansion of the universe  [5]. The amplitude of the CMB temperature fluctuations, combined with other cosmological observations such as the large scale distribution of galaxies and the abundance of galaxy clusters, have led to the development of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (\u039bCDM) model, which is the current standard model of cosmology [6]. This model suggests that the universe is composed of about 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter, and only 5% baryonic matter [7]. Therefore, the observational evidence provided by the CMB temperature fluctuations plays a crucial role in our understanding of the dark matter component in the universe and the formation of large scale structures[8].", "references": ["[4] https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Weinberg/Weinberg4.html\n\n4. BARYON ACOUSTIC OSCILLATIONS\n\n4.1. General Principles\n\nThe baryon acoustic oscillation method relies on the imprint left by sound waves in the early universe to provide a feature of known size in the late-time clustering of matter and galaxies. By measuring this acoustic scale at a variety of redshifts, one can infer D A (z) and H(z). The acoustic length scale can be computed as the comoving distance that the sound waves could travel from the Big Bang until recombination at z = z * (see descriptions by Hu and Sugiyama 1996, Eisenstein and Hu 1998). This is a simple integral\n\n(52)\n\nThe behavior of H(z) at z > z * depends on the ratio of the matter density to radiation density; in simple cosmologies, the radiation sector (photons and neutrinos) is fixed and the ratio is proportional to \u03a9 m h2.

These differences may impact the comparative advantage of countries, trade costs, and serve as non-tariff barriers to trade[2]. First, differences in regulatory environments can affect the cost of production in various countries[3]. Regulations related to labor standards, environmental protection, and taxation can lead to a higher or lower cost of production for businesses in a given country[4]. This, in turn, can influence the comparative advantage of countries, determining which products they are more efficient at producing and the patterns of their international trade[5]. Second, differing regulations pertaining to quality and safety standards can also impact trade patterns[6]. Countries that impose strict quality and safety standards on their products may enjoy a competitive advantage in exports, as their products are perceived as being more reliable and of higher quality[7]. Conversely, countries with lower standards may face difficulties in exporting their products to more regulated markets, as their products may not meet the required criteria[8]. This can lead to a divergence in trade patterns, as countries with higher standards export more to quality-sensitive markets, while countries with lower standards may struggle to find export markets that accept their products[9]. Third, regulatory differences may serve as non-tariff barriers to trade, inhibiting the flow of goods and services between countries[10]. For instance, some countries may impose strict import regulations, such as quotas, licensing requirements, or customs procedures, making it more difficult for businesses in other countries to access their markets[11]. These barriers, in turn, can affect the volume and distribution of international trade, as well as the composition of exports and imports among countries[12]. In conclusion, differences in regulatory environments play a vital role in shaping the patterns of international trade[13]. They can impact the comparative advantage of countries, influence trade costs, and create non-tariff barriers to trade[14].

The term was coined by Kenneth Craik in 1943 who suggested that the mind constructs \"small-scale models\" of reality that it uses to anticipate events.\n\nMental models can help shape behaviour and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal algorithm) and doing tasks.\n\nIn psychology, the term mental models is sometimes used to refer to mental representations or mental simulation generally. The concepts of schema (psychology) and conceptual models are cognitively adjacent. At other times it is used to refer to \u00a7 Mental models and reasoning and to the mental model theory of reasoning developed by Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M.J. Byrne.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nThe term mental model is believed to have originated with Kenneth Craik in his 1943 book The Nature of Explanation.[1][2] Georges-Henri Luquet in Le dessin enfantin (Children's drawings), published in 1927 by Alcan, Paris, argued that children construct internal models, a view that influenced, among others, child psychologist Jean Piaget.\n\nJay Wright Forrester defined general mental models thus:\n\nThe image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971).\n\nPhilip Johnson-Laird published Mental Models: Towards a Cognitive Science of Language, Inference and Consciousness in 1983. In the same year, Dedre Gentner and Albert Stevens edited a collection of chapters in a book also titled Mental Models.[3] The first line of their book explains the idea further: \"One function of this chapter is to belabor the obvious; people's views of the world, of themselves, of their own capabilities, and of the tasks that they are asked to perform, or topics they are asked to learn, depend heavily on the conceptualizations that they bring to the task.\" (see the book: Mental Models).\n\nSince then, there has been much discussion and use of the idea in human-computer interaction and usability by researchers including Donald Norman and Steve Krug (in his book Don't Make Me Think). Walter Kintsch and Teun A. van Dijk, using the term situation model (in their book Strategies of Discourse Comprehension, 1983), showed the relevance of mental models for the production and comprehension of discourse.\n\nCharlie Munger popularized the use of multi-disciplinary mental models for making business and investment decisions.[4]\n\nMental models and reasoning [ edit ]\n\nOne view of human reasoning is that it depends on mental models. In this view, mental models can be constructed from perception, imagination, or the comprehension of discourse (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Such mental models are similar to architects' models or to physicists' diagrams in that their structure is analogous to the structure of the situation that they represent, unlike, say, the structure of logical forms used in formal rule theories of reasoning. In this respect, they are a little like pictures in the picture theory of language described by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in 1922. Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M.J. Byrne developed their mental model theory of reasoning which makes the assumption that reasoning depends, not on logical form, but on mental models (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991).\n\nPrinciples of mental models [ edit ]\n\nMental models are based on a small set of fundamental assumptions (axioms), which distinguish them from other proposed representations in the psychology of reasoning (Byrne and Johnson-Laird, 2009). Each mental model represents a possibility. A mental model represents one possibility, capturing what is common to all the different ways in which the possibility may occur (Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002). Mental models are iconic, i.e., each part of a model corresponds to each part of what it represents (Johnson-Laird, 2006). Mental models are based on a principle of truth: they typically represent only those situations that are possible, and each model of a possibility represents only what is true in that possibility according to the proposition. However, mental models can represent what is false, temporarily assumed to be true, for example, in the case of counterfactual conditionals and counterfactual thinking (Byrne, 2005).\n\nReasoning with mental models [ edit ]\n\nPeople infer that a conclusion is valid if it holds in all the possibilities. Procedures for reasoning with mental models rely on counter-examples to refute invalid inferences; they establish validity by ensuring that a conclusion holds over all the models of the premises. Reasoners focus on a subset of the possible models of multiple-model problems, often just a single model. The ease with which reasoners can make deductions is affected by many factors, including age and working memory (Barrouillet, et al., 2000). They reject a conclusion if they find a counterexample, i.e., a possibility in which the premises hold, but the conclusion does not (Schroyens, et al. 2003; Verschueren, et al., 2005).\n\nCriticisms [ edit ]\n\nScientific debate continues about whether human reasoning is based on mental models, versus formal rules of inference (e.g., O'Brien, 2009), domain-specific rules of inference (e.g., Cheng & Holyoak, 2008; Cosmides, 2005), or probabilities (e.g., Oaksford and Chater, 2007). Many empirical comparisons of the different theories have been carried out (e.g., Oberauer, 2006).\n\nMental models of dynamics systems: mental models in system dynamics [ edit ]\n\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\n\nA mental model is generally:\n\nfounded on unquantifiable, impugnable, obscure, or incomplete facts;\n\nflexible \u2013 considerably variable in positive as well as in negative sense;\n\nan information filter that causes selective perception, perception of only selected parts of information;\n\nvery limited, compared with the complexities of the world, and even when a scientific model is extensive and in accordance with a certain reality in the derivation of logical consequences of it, it must take into account such restrictions as working memory; i.e., rules on the maximum number of elements that people are able to remember, gestaltisms or failure of the principles of logic, etc.;\n\ndependent on sources of information, which one cannot find anywhere else, are available at any time and can be used.[5][6][7]\n\nMental models are a fundamental way to understand organizational learning. Mental models, in popular science parlance, have been described as \"deeply held images of thinking and acting\".[8] Mental models are so basic to understanding the world that people are hardly conscious of them.\n\nExpression of mental models of dynamic systems [ edit ]\n\nS.N. Groesser and M. Schaffernicht (2012) describe three basic methods which are typically used:\n\nCausal loop diagrams \u2013 displaying tendency and a direction of information connections and the resulting causality and feedback loops\n\nSystem structure diagrams \u2013 another way to express the structure of a qualitative dynamic system\n\nStock and flow diagrams - a way to quantify the structure of a dynamic system\n\nThese methods allow showing a mental model of a dynamic system, as an explicit, written model about a certain system based on internal beliefs. Analyzing these graphical representations has been an increasing area of research across many social science fields.[9] Additionally software tools that attempt to capture and analyze the structural and functional properties of individual mental models such as Mental Modeler, \"a participatory modeling tool based in fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping\",[10] have recently been developed and used to collect/compare/combine mental model representations collected from individuals for use in social science research, collaborative decision-making, and natural resource planning.\n\nMental model in relation to system dynamics and systemic thinking [ edit ]\n\nIn the simplification of reality, creating a model can find a sense of reality, seeking to overcome systemic thinking and system dynamics.\n\nThese two disciplines can help to construct a better coordination with the reality of mental models and simulate it accurately. They increase the probability that the consequences of how to decide and act in accordance with how to plan.[5]\n\nSystem dynamics \u2013 extending mental models through the creation of explicit models, which are clear, easily communicated and can be compared with each other.\n\nSystemic thinking \u2013 seeking the means to improve the mental models and thereby improve the quality of dynamic decisions that are based on mental models.\n\nExperimental studies carried out in weightlessness[11] and on Earth using neuroimaging [12] showed that humans are endowed with a mental model of the effects of gravity on object motion.\n\nSingle and double-loop learning [ edit ]\n\nAfter analyzing the basic characteristics, it is necessary to bring the process of changing the mental models, or the process of learning. Learning is a back-loop process, and feedback loops can be illustrated as: single-loop learning or double-loop learning.\n\nSingle-loop learning [ edit ]\n\nMental models affect the way that people work with information, and also how they determine the final decision. The decision itself changes, but the mental models remain the same. It is the predominant method of learning, because it is very convenient.\n\nDouble-loop learning [ edit ]\n\nDouble-loop learning (see diagram below) is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.[6]\n\nProcess of learning Feedback process Single-loop learning Double-loop learning\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_801bdd4c-d0cc-40ce-ba71-5febf548fddf"}

Choose a model: Select a machine learning algorithm or statistical model suitable for predicting sports outcomes[9]. Examples include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks [10]. Train the model: Feed the training data into the algorithm to create a predictive model[11]. The model will learn patterns in the data and adjust its parameters to minimize prediction errors [12].

A number of those structures were built a long time ago, and even some of the more recently built ones were not up to code - factors that experts say likely contributed to the soaring death toll. The disaster in Turkey and Syria has triggered concerns in other disaster-prone areas of the world, including here in the U.S.\n\nJacob Margolis is a reporter for LAist news, and he's here to tell us more about why California, especially, is on alert. Hey, Jacob.\n\nJACOB MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Hey.\n\nCHANG: OK. So before we talk about the problems facing us here in California, what is it about the construction of many of these buildings in Turkey and Syria that collapsed that experts think made those buildings especially vulnerable to earthquake damage?\n\nMARGOLIS: Yeah. It seems that many of the buildings that collapsed were concrete structures that didn't have adequate reinforcement to help them deal with ground motions that were really extreme. We're talking a velocity of - I think it's about three feet a second, which is huge. It's still being investigated, but it will likely be found that some of the structures, they didn't have proper rebar or concrete or even wall-to-floor connections so that when the ground moved that violently, columns collapsed, and then there's nothing holding the big, heavy floors up. And then the rest of the building comes down following it.\n\nNow, like, I want to note - and people should note - Turkey has building codes on par with California and Japan, according to different engineers that I've spoken with. So the question is, like, why did the buildings collapse? And that's all being sorted. I know there's a delegation of engineers heading over to do some assessments, including from the U.S., and we'll learn more once things settle down.\n\nCHANG: Right. But do you have a sense right now of how common those structural vulnerabilities that you've described in concrete buildings in Turkey and Syria - how common those are in California buildings?\n\nMARGOLIS: Yeah. We have a lot of concrete buildings here in California that we know could very well collapse in a big earthquake. Anyone who thinks it's not going to happen or that it couldn't happen is delusional. I mean, we have, for instance, in Los Angeles, a program that is specifically meant for a type of concrete building built prior to the late 1970s that is saying, hey, you need to retrofit these buildings. But the timeline is like 25-plus years probably. Just to put it in perspective, there's a 15% chance that we're going to get hit here in Southern California with a 7.8 magnitude or greater quake sometime in the next 30 years.\n\nCHANG: Right.\n\nMARGOLIS: And so we have a lower concentration of those types of concrete buildings here. And that's one thing that we actually have working for us is that we've got a lot of sprawl, especially here in Southern California, where I am - a lot of single-family, wood-frame homes. And those do pretty well in earthquakes, and they're much easier to retrofit than the big, concrete buildings as well.\n\nCHANG: Well, if experts know that there are these deeply concerning structural weaknesses in so many buildings in California and we are expecting the so-called big one someday here in the state, why haven't these buildings been brought up to code? Like, why are they given so much time to get up to code? What are the challenges?\n\nMARGOLIS: Yeah. So for bigger buildings, retrofits can be extremely expensive. They take a lot of time. And whether we demand those retrofits happen faster is kind of up to, you know, city officials and the public because they do take a lot of money as well.\n\nCHANG: Yeah, a lot of money and a lot of time. Well then, I mean, practically speaking, for the average person, what are, like, next steps people can take if they live or work in a building that they think might not be structurally sound given everything that we've talked about? I mean, what can people actually do?\n\nMARGOLIS: You know, find out if the building has been retrofitted here in Los Angeles. There's a website that you can search to tell you when it was built and if it has been retrofitted. For a lot of other cities, municipalities across the state, I don't think that's necessarily the case. So if it was built prior to the late-1970s and it's a concrete structure, just know that there is a possibility that it could come down in the next big quake.\n\nCHANG: That is Jacob Margolis of LAist news.

Flimsy ground story walls for carports, garages or stores can crumble in an earthquake, and are called \u201csoft-story\u201d buildings, explains U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Ken Hudnut.\n\nSeven years into Los Angeles\u2019 landmark earthquake safety campaign, more than 8,000 seismically vulnerable buildings have been retrofitted across the city at an estimated cost of $1.3 billion, a new analysis shows.\n\nThe improvements mark the biggest advance in seismic upgrades in decades but still leave thousands of buildings vulnerable to damage or even collapse in a catastrophic temblor.\n\nThe regulations, a legacy of Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s push for the nation\u2019s most sweeping earthquake safety legislation, require a total of nearly 14,000 buildings to be retrofitted. The rules came after years of stalled efforts to improve the resilience of buildings despite growing evidence of earthquake threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rules target apartments and other structures with soft, flimsy first floors as well as larger concrete-frame buildings of the type that sustained major damage during the 1971 Sylmar and 1994 Northridge quakes.\n\nMany of the completed retrofits have come in wood-frame, soft-story apartment buildings, where upgrades are considerably cheaper than those in brittle concrete-frame buildings. Under the city\u2019s rules, property owners pay for the structural improvements, but landlords can pass on a portion of the costs to tenants.\n\nCyclists ride past the remains of a collapsed Kaiser Permanente clinic and office building in Granada Hills after the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The structure was a vulnerable concrete building. (Jonathan Alcorn / Los Angeles Times)\n\nEarthquake experts have been pushing communities across California to focus on strengthening key infrastructure to better withstand big quakes, including utilities, water systems and buildings. Though L.A. has targeted thousands of structures, it still has not dealt with another type of vulnerable construction: steel-frame buildings, of which 25 were significantly damaged in the Northridge earthquake. That includes the Automobile Club of Southern California building in Santa Clarita, which came very close to collapsing.\n\n\u201cSteel-frame buildings have the potential to fracture\u201d a key part of their skeleton, said Ryan Kersting, who chairs the policy committee for the Structural Engineers Assn. of California. \u201cAnd once you start to have that fracture, you are concerned with instability and possible collapse of those buildings.\u201d\n\nIt would be important to conduct a case-by-case analysis to understand which buildings are at highest risk of collapse, even at lower shaking intensities, Kersting said. A U.S. Geological Survey simulation released in 2008 of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Southern California said it\u2019s plausible that five high-rise steel buildings holding 5,000 people could collapse.\n\n\u201cWe should be more informed about the risks that we have of our buildings,\u201d Kersting said.\n\nCalifornia Your guide to retrofitting your home for earthquakes Southern California\u2019s housing stock and propensity for earthquakes mean homeowners here need to pay special attention to foundations, chimneys and more. Here\u2019s your guide to retrofitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, L.A. and a handful of other cities have come a long way in the last few years. Cities such as Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Culver City, Beverly Hills and Pasadena now have laws requiring soft-story buildings to be retrofitted. In Northern California, San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland have such laws on the books as well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really big, and really huge, with really big benefits,\u201d seismologist Lucy Jones said. \u201cThe most satisfying thing has been the really big shift about softer-story [buildings] and all that\u2019s been able to be done about that.\u201d\n\nThe report shows the benefits of L.A.\u2019s law requiring soft-story buildings, also known as dingbats, to be retrofitted. A telltale sign of these structures are those with housing units above carports propped up by flimsy poles, which are vulnerable to collapse in an earthquake.\n\nKehl Tonga of Cal-Quake Construction installs a steel support to strengthen a quake-vulnerable soft-story apartment building in Hollywood. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIn the 1994 Northridge earthquake, about 200 soft-story buildings collapsed, including one apartment building in which 16 people died.\n\nThe report\u2019s release comes 14 years after the first ShakeOut, a giant earthquake drill that asks residents to simulate what they would do in a temblor.\n\nOf the 12,604 soft-story buildings identified by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, 8,228 have been retrofitted, or 65%. Retrofit building permits also have been issued for an additional 2,068 buildings.\n\nThe skinny, flimsy columns supporting this El Centro apartment building left the structure unstable after a 2010 earthquake (Fred Turner / California Seismic Safety Commission)\n\nThe study by structural engineer Keith Porter, an expert on California seismic safety issues, estimated that the retrofit of 8,100 soft-story apartment buildings in Los Angeles \u2014 that was the total when the analysis was conducted \u2014 strengthened 117,000 housing units. Officials estimate that the typical retrofit of a soft-story building in L.A. costs $80,000 to $160,000.\n\nPorter estimated that property owners in L.A. have spent $1.3 billion so far on these retrofits.\n\nBut the benefits are already immense. Porter calculated that the retrofits will reduce future financial losses by $41 billion and avert 1,500 deaths and 27,000 nonfatal injuries and cases of post-traumatic stress disorder. The retrofits also are expected to prevent 5,000 housing units from collapsing and an additional 60,000 from being significantly damaged.\n\nUnshaken The guide to earthquake readiness and resilience that you\u2019ll actually use.\n\nCalling it \u201ca very cost-effective investment,\u201d Porter calculated that every dollar invested in a retrofit will save $32 had the property owner not paid for seismic upgrades.\n\n\u201cThese estimates omit important but hard-to-quantify benefits such as protecting mementos, pets, peace of mind, community and culture,\u201d Porter wrote. \u201cThey ignore debris disposal, the energy embodied in repairing or replacing the buildings, and the increase in housing costs that accompany reduced housing supply.\n\n\u201cAnd this analysis is silent on the potential for displaced residents to become homeless, with attendant mental and physical health impacts, demands on public services and other harms,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRetrofitting these buildings today will keep many tenants in their homes,\u201d Porter said. \u201cThe retrofits will avoid thousands of injuries that would otherwise require emergency medical care, freeing up medical resources when they are in sudden, severe demand. The avoided losses benefit everyone.\u201d\n\nCalifornia How earthquakes happen: The science of a shake Before we can prepare for the Big One, we have to know what \u201cone\u201d is. Here\u2019s a basic primer on the science of earthquakes.\n\nL.A.\u2019s seismic retrofit law was passed after a Times analysis published in 2013 found that more than 1,000 old concrete buildings may be at risk of collapse in a major earthquake. The city had long known about the risk but had done little about it in the years after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.\n\nEarly in his term in January 2014, Garcetti announced a partnership with Jones to develop recommendations on addressing earthquake vulnerability issues. Jones, previously a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, was a key figure behind ShakeOut, the name for both the giant earthquake drill and the release of a report in 2008 showing the effect of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault. In that scenario, scientists estimated a quake could cause 1,800 deaths, 50,000 injuries and $200 billion in damage and other losses.\n\nBy the end of 2014, Garcetti proposed a sweeping set of seismic safety rules that won the unanimous support of the City Council the following year.\n\nVehicles crushed when a soft-story apartment building collapsed during the Northridge earthquake in 1994.\n\n(Roland Otero / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut the work is not done. Improvements on the reliability of the electrical grid and fuel pipelines has been uneven, Jones said, and she remains concerned about the stability of Southern California\u2018s water supply.\n\nL.A. has made slow progress on getting brittle concrete buildings retrofitted. City data show that only two of L.A.\u2019s 1,337 brittle concrete buildings have received certificates of compliance showing they meet the standards of the retrofit law.\n\nOwners of concrete buildings were given much longer to get them retrofitted \u2014 25 years, compared with the seven years that owners of soft-story buildings had to upgrade.\n\nSome owners of soft-story buildings began receiving orders to retrofit in 2016, meaning they still have some time before the seven-year deadline passes. Other owners began getting orders in 2017.\n\nConcrete buildings can be especially deadly because they are so massive. The collapse of two concrete buildings in a quake in New Zealand in 2011 resulted in 133 deaths.\n\nJones remains particularly concerned about old brick buildings. A Times analysis in 2018 found that there were as many as 640 unreinforced masonry buildings in more than a dozen Inland Empire cities, including Riverside, Pomona and San Bernardino, that have been marked as dangerous but remained unretrofitted despite decades of warnings.\n\nLittle has been done to get those buildings retrofitted, despite the fact that the San Andreas fault runs through the region. By contrast, L.A. ordered that such structures be retrofitted or demolished decades ago.\n\nIn a statement, Garcetti said he hoped L.A. could be a model.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s still work to be done, we\u2019ve positioned the city to continue expanding critical building requirements and serving as a model for cities around the world of what it looks like to be earthquake-ready,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the 2011 New Zealand earthquake, more than 40 people died when brick and stone buildings collapsed. Most were not inside the buildings, but were killed by falling debris while on the sidewalk or in a vehicle on an adjacent road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we know those are ones that are going to kill people,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt requires thinking beyond the short term and believing in community and communal investments.\u201d\n\nBricks from collapsed buildings fill a street in Christchurch, New Zealand, after an earthquake in 2011. More than 40 people died from the collapse of brick structures during the temblor. (Martin Hunter / Getty Images)\n\nJones is also concerned about California\u2019s minimum building standards, which still allow the construction of new buildings that can be so severely damaged in a major earthquake that they must be torn down. Quake safety advocates have promoted a new building standard that would have structures built stronger in the first place, so they can be repaired and reoccupied relatively quickly after a major temblor.\n\nThen-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 vetoed a bill intended to strengthen the minimum construction requirements. The proposed law would have established a committee to evaluate whether a tougher building standard should be adopted and offer input on whether the new rule should be mandatory.\n\nPorter has previously estimated that strengthening California\u2019s minimum building standards would increase construction costs by 1% to 2%.\n\n\u201cThink of how many buildings have been built in downtown Los Angeles in the last 15 years. There\u2019s a lot of them, and they are built to be a total financial loss\u201d if built to the existing minimum construction standard, Jones said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the economy of Southern California if we can\u2019t use the buildings in downtown L.A.?\u201d"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_fcd0afb1-101d-496c-8f03-d78006431eab"}

Cement, primarily composed of calcium silicates, is a common binding material used in making concrete, mortar, and other building materials [2]. In contrast, silica fume, a byproduct of the silicon and ferrosilicon industries, is a fine-grained, high-strength pozzolanic material that can be added to concrete mixtures to improve their performance and durability [3]. The choice between cement and silica fume depends on the specific requirements of the construction project[4]. Cement is a more versatile material, suitable for a wide range of applications, including residential and commercial buildings, roads, bridges, and other infrastructures [5]. It provides adequate compressive strength, durability, and workability for typical construction scenarios[6]. On the other hand, silica fume is primarily used as an admixture to enhance the properties of concrete [7]. It can increase the concrete's strength, durability, and resistance to chemical attack [8]. By reducing the permeability and porosity of the concrete, silica fume can help protect the embedded steel reinforcement from corrosion [9]. Additionally, it can improve the bond between the concrete and reinforcement, reducing the likelihood of cracking and failure [10]. However, it is important to note that silica fume is not a replacement for cement but rather an additive [11]. When used in combination with cement, it can significantly improve the performance of concrete in demanding applications such as high-rise buildings, bridges, marine structures, and wastewater treatment facilities [12]. In summary, the choice between cement and silica fume depends on the requirements of the construction project[13]. Cement is a versatile material suitable for general construction purposes, while silica fume can improve the performance and durability of concrete when used as an additive alongside cement [14].

For the sphere S^2, which is a 2-dimensional sphere, you want to compute its homotopy groups \u03c0_n(S^2) for various n. Here are some results for the homotopy groups of S^2 :\n\n1[4].

For n=1, the 1st homotopy group \u03c0_1(S^2) is also trivial because S^2 is simply connected, meaning it has no non-trivial loops that cannot be continuously shrunk to a point [6]. For n=2, the 2nd homotopy group \u03c0_2(S^2) is isomorphic to the group of integers Z, meaning there is one generator for each integer (positive or negative) representing distinct homotopy classes of maps S^2 -> S^2[7]. In other words, the 2-spheres in S^2 can be wrapped around it multiple times, and each distinct wrapping corresponds to an integer [8]. For n > 2, determining the homotopy groups involves using various algebraic and geometric techniques, such as the Hopf fibration, cellular homotopy groups, and homotopy groups of CW complexes [9].

", "references": ["Magma is a boiling liquid and semi-liquid rock. It usually consists of silicate liquid, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, etc. It also contains dissolved gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur. Today we are discussing the magma formation. Let\u2019s start!\n\nWhat is Magma?\n\nMagma is a wholly or partially molten rock stored under the earth\u2019s surface. If this reaches the surface, it will be called or referred to as lava. Lava is also characterized as lava tube and lava flow, which we discussed in the previous post.\n\nOrigin: Most of the time, Magma is found in Earth\u2019s uppermost mantle. The greatest quantities are produced in divergent and convergent plate boundaries or hot spots.\n\nComposition of magma: Magma consists of three components. It consists of a liquid component, a salt component, and a gaseous component. The liquid component is mostly mobile ions of the eight most common elements found in Earth\u2019s crust.\n\nSo silicon, oxygen, aluminum, potassium, calcium, sodium, iron, and magnesium are the most common elements in Earth\u2019s crust. They are the ayahs that find in magma. The gaseous component of magma is mostly water vapor, carbon dioxide, or sulfur dioxide.\n\nTypes of magma: There are four types of magma.\n\nUltramafic \u2013 Silicon dioxide 45%, Very high in Iron, Magnesium, and Calcium, and Low in Potassium, Sodium. Mafic or Basaltic \u2013 Silicon dioxide 45-55%, Very high in Iron, Magnesium, and Calcium and Low in Potassium, Sodium. Intermediate or andesitic \u2013 Silicon dioxide 55-65%, Iron, Magnesium. Felsic or Rhyolitic \u2013 Silicon dioxide 65-75%, Low in Iron, Magnesium & High in Potassium, Sodium.\n\nCharacteristic of magma: Viscosity is the resistance to flow. If magma is very molten, it will flow quickly and not be very viscous. But if you have magma that is not very hot, it will not flow very quickly.\n\nThe high percentage of silicon dioxide or sulfur dioxide in the magma contains higher viscosity. Lower temperature magmas have a higher viscosity, and higher temperature Magnus has lower viscosities.\n\nMagma crystallization: Magma becomes rock through crystallization. When energy is removed, the atoms pack and turn from gaseous to liquid. Then it goes from a liquid state to a solid state. The ions and the atoms will pack when it cools or loses all their heat and energy. Then It creates crystals.\n\nHow Does Magma Form?\n\nMagma is formed through a process known as magma generation or magmatism. It occurs beneath the Earth\u2019s surface and involves the melting of rocks in the Earth\u2019s mantle and crust. Several processes can lead to magma formation:\n\nDecompression melting: This occurs when the pressure on a rock decreases, typically due to the upward movement of tectonic plates or mantle plumes. As the pressure decreases, the melting point of the rock decreases, causing it to melt and form magma.\n\nFlux melting: When water or other volatile substances are introduced into the Earth\u2019s mantle or crust, they can lower the melting point of rocks. This process is known as flux melting. Water-rich fluids are often released during subduction, where one tectonic plate moves beneath another. These fluids can cause the overlying rocks to melt and generate magma.\n\nHeat transfer: Magma can also form through heat transfer from a nearby magma body or the Earth\u2019s mantle. The heat raises the temperature of the surrounding rocks, causing them to melt and form magma.\n\nOnce magma forms, it is less dense than the surrounding rocks, so it rises toward the Earth\u2019s surface. Then it moves upward, the magma can undergo further changes, such as crystallization, differentiation, and mixing with other magmas. When magma reaches the surface, it is called lava, and it can erupt through volcanic vents or fissures, resulting in volcanic activity.\n\nMagma formation, at first, needs specific conditions like hot enough rock to rise above the melting point of the minerals. Depending on the type, it makes up that rock, usually between 800 to 1900 degrees Celsius. It will take more heat to make the rock melt at higher pressures.\n\nMagma Formation\n\nThe pressure tends to inhibit the melting of the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere moves up into this lower-pressure region. It\u2019s still hot, which a temperature is 1300 Celsius or higher.\n\nMagma can lose heat simply by being erupted onto the earth\u2019s surface. Magma will contact the atmosphere or the oceans when it erupts onto the earth\u2019s surface. In both cases, hot magma comes into contact with something quite cold.\n\nIt means lava will quickly lose heat to the atmosphere or the oceans through conduction and radiation. Magma will cool down very fast and solidify to give solid volcanic rock.\n\nHow does nature create magma? Nature makes magma in three different ways.\n\ni) The first one results from decreased pressure without increasing temperature, which can melt decompression. So decompression melting can create magma.\n\nii) The other way data creates magma is by introducing water or sometimes impurities. It can sufficiently lower the melting temperature of hot mantle rocks to generate magma.\n\niii) The third-way nature creates magma is by heating crustal rocks above the melting temperature. When this heat is transferred to the rocks surrounding it, it causes them to melt and rise to the surface.\n\nIf magma crystallizes inside the earth without coming out on the surface, it is called magma and intrusive or plutonic igneous rock. If magma comes out and cools down on the surface, it creates volcanic or extrusive igneous rocks. Also, if a volcano erupts, all the molten rock that comes out is called lava, not magma.\n\nHow is magma formed? Magma can be formed by melting the earth\u2019s crust or within the mantle. Crust and mantle are almost entirely solid, indicating that magma only forms in special places where pre-existing solid rocks melt. There are three conditions for forming magma.\n\n1. Temperature: A rising magma from the mantle brings the heat with it and transfers heat to their surrounding rocks at shallower depths which may melt.\n\nIt will melt whenever the temperature is high enough for the rock to hit the melting point. But that melting point depends on how much pressure the rock is under. Different layers act differently if it\u2019s under a lot of pressure and the melting point increases.\n\n2. Pressure: Melting occurs due to a decrease in pressure. It is also called decompression melt. So the decrease in pressure affecting a hot mantle rock at a constant temperature permits melting, forming magma. When pressure is decreased, melting can occur because the bonds between particles can be broken down.\n\n3. Volatiles: Adding volatiles like water decreases rock\u2019s melting point. At convergence zones, the subducting plate heats, causing a release of water. It decreases the melting point of the surrounding rock. This rock melt generates magma.\n\nThere are 2 processes referred to for magma formation.\n\n1. Decompression melting: Decompression melting creates magma by reducing pressure at a constant temperature. It occurs at divergent boundaries where tectonic plates separate.\n\n2. Flux melting: Flux melting occurs after introducing volatile, breaking the rock\u2019s chemical bond. Also, It occurs when water or carbon dioxide is added to rock. These compounds cause the rock to melt at lower temperatures.\n\nMagma can also create when hot, liquid rock enters Earth\u2019s cold crust. As the liquid rock solidifies, it loses heat to the surrounding crust.\n\nWhy does magma rise to the surface?\n\nMagma is liquid, and magma rocks are solid salt materials denser than liquid materials. Therefore the liquid material will rise to the top, and the solid material will stay at the bottom. That\u2019s why magma rises to the top. Magma is less dense than the solid rocks around it. That\u2019s why it will rise to the top.\n\nRead More: Why Do Volcanoes Erupt?\n\nReferences:\n\nBOWEN, NORMAN. \u201cMAGMAS. \u201d Geological Society of America Bulletin.\n\nGreeley, Ronald; Schneid, Byron. \u201cMagma Generation on Mars: Amounts, Rates, and Comparisons with Earth, Moon, and Venus.\u201d Science.\n\nSpera, Frank, \u201cPhysical Properties of Magma,\u201d in Sigurdsson, Haraldur (editor-in-chief) (ed.), Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, Academic Press.\n\nFoulger, G.R.

", "references": ["Contents\n\nContents\n\nIdea\n\nAn A \u221e A_\\infty -category is a kind of category in which the associativity condition on the composition of morphisms is relaxed \u201cup to higher coherent homotopy\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cA\u201d is for Associative and the \u201c \u221e {}_\\infty \u201d indicates that associativity is relaxed up to higher homotopies without bound on the degree of the homotopies.\n\nIn the most widespread use of the word A \u221e A_\\infty -categories are linear categories in that they have hom-objects that are chain complexes. These are really models/presentations for stable (\u221e,1)-categories.\n\nIf higher coherences in a linear A \u221e A_\\infty -category happen to be equal to identity morphisms (which is encoded by the vanishing of the maps m n m_n for n \u2265 3 n\\ge3 , defined below), it becomes the same as a dg-category. In fact, every linear A \u221e A_\\infty -category is A \u221e A_\\infty -equivalent to a dg-category. In this way, we have that A \u221e A_\\infty -categories related to dg-categories as models for stable (\u221e,1)-categories in roughly the same way as quasi-categories relate to simplicially enriched categories as models for (\u221e,1)-categories: the former is the general incarnation, while the latter is a semi-strictified version.\n\nOrdinary linear A \u221e A_\\infty -categories\n\nIn what is strictly speaking a restrictive sense \u2013 which is however widely and conventionally understood in homological algebra as the standard notion of A \u221e A_\\infty -category (see references below) \u2013 the hom-spaces of an A \u221e A_\\infty -category are taken to be linear spaces, i.e. modules over some ring or field, and in fact chain complexes of such modules.\n\nTherefore an A \u221e A_\\infty -category in this standard sense of homological algebra is a category which is in some way homotopically enriched over a category of chain complexes Ch Ch . Since a category which is enriched in the ordinary sense of enriched category theory is a dg-category, there is a close relation between A \u221e A_\\infty -categories and dg-categories.\n\nA \u221e A_\\infty -categories in this linear sense are a horizontal categorification of the notion of A-infinity-algebra. As such they are to A-infinity-algebras as Lie infinity-algebroids are to L-infinity-algebras. For this point of view see Konsevich-Soibelman 08.\n\nDefinition A category C C such that for all X , Y X,Y in Ob ( C ) Ob(C) the Hom-sets Hom C ( X , Y ) Hom_C(X,Y) are finite dimensional chain complexes of Z \\mathbf{Z} -graded modules for all objects X 1 , . . . , X n X_1,...,X_n in Ob ( C ) Ob(C) there is a family of linear composition maps (the higher compositions) m n : Hom C ( X 0 , X 1 ) \u2297 Hom C ( X 1 , X 2 ) \u2297 \u22ef \u2297 Hom C ( X n \u2212 1 , X n ) \u2192 Hom C ( X 0 , X n ) m_n : Hom_C(X_0,X_1) \\otimes Hom_C(X_1,X_2) \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes Hom_C(X_{n-1},X_n) \\to Hom_C(X_0,X_n) of degree n \u2212 2 n-2 (homological grading convention is used) for n \u2265 1 n\\geq1 m 1 m_1 is the differential on the chain complex Hom C ( X , Y ) Hom_C(X,Y) m n m_n satisfy the quadratic A \u221e A_\\infty -associativity equation for all n \u2265 0 n\\geq0 .\n\nm 1 m_1 and m 2 m_2 will be chain maps but the compositions m i m_i of higher order are not chain maps, nevertheless they are Massey products.\n\nThe framework of dg-categories and dg-functors is too narrow for many problems, and it is preferable to consider the wider class of A \u221e A_\\infty -categories and A \u221e A_\\infty -functors. Many features of A \u221e A_\\infty -categories and A \u221e A_\\infty -functors come from the fact that they form a symmetric closed multicategory, which is revealed in the language of comonads.\n\nFrom a higher dimensional perspective A \u221e A_\\infty -categories are weak \u03c9 \\omega -categories with all morphisms invertible. A \u221e A_\\infty -categories can also be viewed as noncommutative formal dg-manifolds with a closed marked subscheme of objects.\n\nExamples (and remarks)\n\nEvery dg-category may be regarded as a special case when there are no higher maps (trivial homotopies) of an A \u221e A_\\infty -category.\n\nEvery A \u221e A_\\infty -category is A \u221e A_\\infty -equivalent to a dg-category. This is a corollary of the A \u221e A_\\infty -categorical Yoneda lemma. beware that this statement does not imply that the notion of A \u221e A_\\infty -categories is obsolete (see section 1.8 in Bespalov et al.): in practice it is often easier to work with a given naturally arising A \u221e A_\\infty -category than constructing its equivalent dg-category for instance when dealing with a Fukaya? A \u221e A_\\infty -category; or when dealing with various constructions on dg-categories, for instance certain quotients,that naturally yield directly A \u221e A_\\infty -categories instead of dg-categories.\n\nThe path space of a topological space X X\n\nThe Fukaya category Fuk ( X ) Fuk(X) of a topological space X X \u2013 a Calabi-Yau A-\u221e category\n\nA \u221e A_\\infty -algebras are the A \u221e A_\\infty -categories with one object.

The tax rates vary depending on your age, residency status, and income level. The tax threshold for individuals ranges from R91,250 to R151,100 depending on age[1]. The tax rates for individuals range from 18% to 45% depending on income[1].\n\n", "references": ["What are your tax obligations in South Africa? We explain the South African tax system, local tax rates, filing tax returns, and VAT.\n\nYou must pay South African taxes if you work in South Africa or own a South African business. The amount you\u2019ll pay depends on certain factors, such as whether you are a resident or non-resident.\n\nExplore the various aspects of taxes in South Africa, including the following:\n\nThe tax system in South Africa\n\nSouth Africa uses a residence-based taxation system whereby residents are taxed on worldwide income and non-residents are taxed on South African-sourced income. With 23.9 million of its 59 million-strong population registered for personal income tax, most of the state\u2019s income comes from personal and corporate tax. Indirect taxes, though, such as Value-Added Tax do account for nearly a third of the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal taxes in South Africa\n\nThe South African government levies a series of direct taxes on citizens and companies operating in South Africa. These include income and business taxes, capital gains, and inheritance taxes.\n\nIndirect taxes such as Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Fuel Duty also apply, as well as contributions towards social security in South Africa.\n\nMore information on who has to pay is available from the South African Revenue Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaxes on goods and services in South Africa\n\nVAT in South Africa is levied on the consumption of goods and services. The VAT rate in South Africa is currently 15% on most goods and services and on imported goods, though there are some exceptions, for example some financial services.\n\nBusinesses are responsible for paying VAT to the government but they can pass on this charge to their customers or clients by adding VAT to the cost of invoiced goods and services.\n\nBusinesses must register for VAT in South Africa if their annual turnover exceeds R1 million within a 12-month period.\n\nCan you get a refund on VAT?\n\nTourists and diplomats visiting South Africa can claim a refund of the VAT they paid on goods purchased in the country. To qualify, you\u2019ll need to be a non-resident foreign passport holder or a South African passport holder who is now a permanent resident of another country. You can reclaim VAT when leaving the country by declaring the goods in question to a customs official.\n\nThe South African government\u2019s guide to VAT refunds for tourists offers further information on how to make a claim.\n\nWho has to pay tax in South Africa?\n\nYou must pay taxes in South Africa if you:\n\nAre a permanent or temporary resident of South Africa \u2013 if you have South African citizenship or a South African residence permit, you must pay taxes.\n\nHave lived in South Africa for more than 91 days in each of the last five tax years, and at least 915 days in total across those five years.\n\nAre a homeowner in South Africa. All homeowners (even non-residents) must register with the SARS in the event they are liable to pay capital gains tax on property.\n\nEarn more than R1.25 million in foreign employment income as a tax resident.\n\nThere are exemptions to these rules, for example, if you are elderly and/or make under a certain amount annually. However, if you qualify as a tax resident in South Africa, you must register as a taxpayer by visiting your local SARS branch to verify your identity, address, and bank details. You can finish the remainder of the process online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth African tax system for foreigners\n\nForeign residents pay the same income tax in South Africa as local citizens. For expats relocating to South Africa, there are a number of countries that have tax treaties with South Africa, including Australia, Japan, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which can help you to avoid double taxation in your home country.\n\nSince 1 March 2020, foreign employment income earned by a tax resident in excess of R1.25 million has been taxed in South Africa according to the tax tables for that year. This applies to residents who spend more than 183 days, of which at least 60 days are continuous, outside of South Africa in any 12-month period during that year of assessment.\n\nPensions\n\nThere is no tax on international pensions in South Africa. Local pensions, though, pay tax at various rates depending on whether it is a lump-sum or an annuity. South Africa is part of the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) system, a new global standard that aims to crack down on cross-border tax evasion.\n\nWithholding tax on interest or royalties\n\nThese are two taxes apply on interest or royalties paid to or for the benefit of a foreign person outside South Africa. The South African tax rate for this is 15%. The foreign person is liable for the tax, but the person making the payment must withhold it. There are certain exemptions, however.\n\nFiling US taxes from South Africa\n\nEvery US citizen and Green Card holder must file a tax return with the IRS even when living abroad.\n\nMany are unaware of these obligations, thinking that as an expat they do not need to pay or file tax returns in the US. You do! For more information and help filing your US tax returns from South Africa, see our guide to filing US taxes from abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncome tax rates in South Africa\n\nEarnings received from employment income, self-employed trade, rental income, investment income, and pension income are subject to income tax. Self-employed people pay income tax at the same levels as employees in South Africa.\n\nThese are South Africa\u2019s income tax bands for the 2023 tax year (1 March 2023 to 29 February 2024):\n\n\u200bTaxable income (R) \u200bRates of tax (R) Up to R237,100 18% of taxable income R237,101\u2013R370,500 R42,678 + 26% of taxable income above R237,100 R370,501\u2013R512,800 R77,362 + 31% of taxable income above R370,500 R512,801\u2013R673,000 R121,475 + 36% of taxable income above R512,800 R673,001\u2013R857,900 R179,147 + 39% of taxable income above R673,000 R857,901\u2013R1,817,000 R251,258 + 41% of taxable income above R857,900 R1,817,001 and above R644,489 + 45% of taxable income above R1,817,000\n\nTax calculators\n\nThere are a number of online income tax calculators where you can work out how much you\u2019ll need to pay, including those from:\n\nHow to file your income tax return in South Africa\n\nResidents who pay taxes in South Africa have to fill in an annual tax return form and submit it to SARS. The South African tax year runs from 1 March to 28/29 February. The tax season, when people submit their tax return forms, is from July to November depending on the filing method. Individuals and business taxpayers are required to make the necessary payments along with their South African tax returns.\n\nThis will be any amount owed that hasn\u2019t been paid through the Pay-as-You-Earn (PAYE) system, where tax contributions are automatically deducted from your wages. If you have to pay more in tax, payments can be made to SARS using any of the following methods:\n\nAt a bank\n\nVia a SARS eFiling\n\nVia an electronic funds transfer\n\nKeep in mind that not filing your tax return can result in a penalty ranging from R250 to R16,000 for each month that you don\u2019t comply. Furthermore, a 2021 law made tax negligence a potential criminal offense, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years.\n\nSelf-employed income tax in South Africa\n\nThough self-employed people are subject to income tax at the same levels as employees in South Africa, there are a few deductions you may be able to claim, for example, certain home office expenses. For information that\u2019s more specific to your work and financial situation, be sure to consult a tax specialist.\n\nTax on property and wealth in South Africa\n\nTransfer Duty\n\nAny property acquired in a sales transaction is subject to transfer duty. Since 1 March 2023, the South African tax rates for transfer duty are progressive at the following rates:\n\nProperty value Rates of tax R0\u2013R1,100,000 0% R1,100,001\u2013R1,512,500 3% on the value above R 1,100,000 R1,512,501\u2013R2,117,500 R12,375 + 6% on the value above R1,512,500 R2,117,501\u2013R2,722,500 R48,675 + 8% on the value above R2,117,500 R2,722,501\u2013R12,100,000 R97,075 + 11% on the value above R2,722,500 R12,100,000+ R1,268,000 + 13% on the value above R12,100,000\n\nTransfer duty is payable by the person acquiring the property and should be paid within six months from the date of acquisition to avoid incurring interest.\n\nTax on rental income\n\nIf you receive income from a rental property, you should declare this on your income tax. Though you will be taxed on this income, be sure to declare your expenses because certain ones \u2013 like agent fees, some insurance, and advertising \u2013 can be deducted. The SARS website has more information about tax on rental income.\n\nDonations tax\n\nDonations tax is a South African property tax payable on the value of any property disposed of as a donation. This is set at 20% of the property value up to R30 million, and 25% on properties valued at more. The tax is payable by the donor. It must be paid by the end of the month following the month in which the donation was made.\n\nThere are plenty of exemptions, including if the property recipient is a spouse, a segment of the government, or a public benefit organization. A donation is also exempt if the total yearly value of donations does not exceed R100,000 for individuals (R10,000 for businesses).\n\nCapital gains tax\n\nCapital gains tax is not a separate tax in South Africa but instead forms a part of income tax. Thus, any profit when selling an asset is subject to the same rates as South African income tax.\n\nInheritance tax in South Africa\n\nEstate duty is the name for inheritance tax in South Africa, which is a property tax payable on all estates with a net worth in excess of R3,500,000. The tax rate in South Africa for estate duty is 20% of properties worth up to R30 million and is 25% of properties worth more than this.\n\nThe South African government has agreements to avoid double death duties with Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zimbabwe.\n\nRetirement property\n\nThose who retire in South Africa pay estate duty on property, wherever it is, in the event of their death.\n\nProperties located outside of South Africa are exempt if they were acquired prior to residency or were inherited from or donated by someone who is not a South African resident.\n\nCompany taxes and VAT rates in South Africa\n\nCorporate tax is payable on business income for all businesses and companies registered in South Africa. This includes:\n\nListed and unlisted public companies\n\nPrivate companies\n\nClose corporations\n\nCooperatives\n\nCollective investment schemes\n\nSmall businesses\n\nShare block companies\n\nCorporate bodies\n\nPublic benefit companies\n\nDormant companies\n\nCorporate tax in South Africa is charged at a flat rate of 28% for all companies (which will decrease to 27% for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023). Small business corporations are taxed at lower progressive rates, starting at 7% on taxable income above R95,750, 21% for income between R365,000 and R550,000, and 28% for income exceeding R550,000.\n\nSkills Development Levy (SDL)\n\nSDL is a tax in South Africa payable by employers to promote learning and development of employees in South Africa. Employers become liable for SDL if their total annual salary bill is more than R500,000.\n\nSDL is charged to employers at a rate of 1% of the total salary bill. It is paid monthly by employers to SARS and the money is used for the skills development of employees.\n\nDividends tax\n\nA tax imposed on dividends payments, the dividends tax rate is 20%. This is a separate tax that is withheld from the dividend payment by the company making the payment, so is not something that needs to be accounted for nor paid by the payment recipient.\n\nSecurities transfer tax\n\nSecurities transfer tax is levied at 0.25% on every transfer of either a share or depository receipt in a company, or a member\u2019s interest in a close corporation.\n\nTurnover tax\n\nTurnover tax in South Africa is an alternate, simplified method of taxation for small businesses with an annual turnover of R1 million or less. It replaces income tax, capital gains, dividends tax, and VAT in South Africa, although there is an option to remain in the VAT system.\n\nThe turnover tax rates in South Africa are progressive, as follows:\n\nR0\u2013R335,000 \u2013 0%\n\n\u2013 0% R335,001\u2013R500,000 \u2013 1% of each R1 above R335,000\n\n\u2013 1% of each R1 above R335,000 R500,001\u2013R750,000 \u2013 R1,650 + 2% of the amount above R500,000\n\n\u2013 R1,650 + 2% of the amount above R500,000 R750,001 and above \u2013 R6,650 + 3% of the amount above R750,000\n\nImport and export taxes in South Africa\n\nCustoms duties\n\nCustoms duties are taxed on imported goods with the aim of raising revenue and protecting the local market. This tax is paid in addition to VAT and is usually calculated as a percentage of the value of goods.\n\nCertain food, drink, textile, and firearms products may be taxed according to volume.\n\nExcise duties and levies\n\nExcise duties and levies are imposed on high-volume daily consumable products (e.g., petroleum, alcohol, tobacco), as well as some non-essential and luxury items (e.g., electronic equipment, cosmetics).\n\nIn addition to raising revenue, this tax exists to discourage the consumption of products considered harmful to the environment. The rates of these taxes in South Africa vary from product to product.\n\nOther indirect taxes\n\nUnemployment Insurance Fund (UIF)\n\nUIF is an unemployment benefit fund payable to those who have been in employment for at least 24 hours per week if they become unemployed, sick, or take maternity leave.\n\nIt is a short-term, contribution-based benefit and is funded through contributions of 2% of the employee\u2019s salary (1% from the employer and 1% from the employee). It is the employer\u2019s responsibility to pay this out of employee salaries each month to SARS.\n\nFuel tax\n\nThe fuel tax is levied on petrol and diesel fuels. This tax can vary but, after the most recent fuel hikes, it is currently around 40% and included in the cost that consumers pay for fuel.\n\nTax advice in South Africa\n\nTaxes can be complicated, especially when you\u2019ve moved to a new country and need to get your head around the system.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s possible to get professional help. If you\u2019re filing your taxes in South Africa for the first time, it can be a smart move to employ an accountant. Likewise, you should consider taking independent financial advice on your business tax liabilities if you\u2019re setting up a company in South Africa.\n\nYou can get professional advice from the South African Institute of Tax Professionals on a range of tax-related issues.\n\nUseful resources"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_a5594352-684c-4e7e-8bb1-4ba9d0e63ce4"}

The ability of GC-MS to determine the composition of unknown organic mixtures makes it the definitive method for NIAS testing of food contact materials, which involves screening the sample for contaminants without prior information about which ones are present. Other food contact material testing applications include printing ink set-off testing and phthalates analysis.\n\nIn addition, GC-MS is commonly used in environmental analysis to screen water samples for volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) and various sample types for harmful PAH compounds. It also has multiple applications in food industry quality control, for example, determining the fatty acid profile of oils and detecting dioxins and PCBs in food, water, and feed.\n\nGas chromatography\n\nGas chromatography ( GC) is used to separate compounds based on their boiling points and polarities. The sample is vaporized to achieve the gas phase. The gaseous sample is then separated into its components in a capillary column. The column itself is coated with a solid stationary phase and the sample is propelled forward by an inert gas used as a moving phase. In this way, different compounds are separated from each other.\n\nThe compounds are then eluted from the column at different times based on their boiling point and polarity. The retention time ( RT) of a single compound, that is the time it takes for the compound to go through the column, is affected by the length and temperature of the column and the flow rate of the carrier gas. The concentrations of the compounds in the sample can be determined using internal and external standards ( i.e. determining the fatty acid composition of cooking oil).\n\nMass spectrometry\n\nMass spectrometry ( MS) identifies different compounds separated in a gas chromatograph by creating a mass spectrum that is unique for every compound. Mass spectrometry also detects the quantities of the compounds by producing peaks in the data. These peaks are proportional to the amount of the compound of interest.\n\nIn mass spectrometry, either electron or chemical ionization is used to ionize and fragment the compound giving the fragments a positive charge. The fragmented molecules ( ions) are then accelerated through a mass analyzer which includes either a quadrupole or an ion trap. In the mass analyzer, the ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ( m/z) ratios with the help of a magnet which bends the stream of the ions toward a detector. Bigger particles take longer to turn than smaller ones, which is why different particles hit the detector in different locations. Thus, the fragmented molecules can be separated and identified by their different masses and they appear as a function of their m/z ratios in the spectrum produced by the mass spectrometer.\n\nThe peak areas in the MS spectrum are proportional to the quantity of the corresponding compound. A complex sample produces numerous different peaks in the gas chromatograph and each peak generates a unique mass spectrum. The identification and quantification of unknown compounds are done by comparing the mass spectra obtained to libraries of mass spectra.\n\nSuitable samples for GC-MS\n\nGC-MS is well suited for studying many different compounds from a wide variety of sample matrices. A requirement for GC-MS analysis is that the compounds in the sample are volatile or semi-volatile so that they can be separated from each other with a gas chromatograph and identified by a mass spectrometer. Many gaseous, liquid, and solid samples are suitable for GC-MS analysis without significant pretreatment. However, the analysis of complex samples or very small sample amounts may require more preparation.\n\nSample preparation\n\nGases and very easily volatile samples can be analyzed by collecting the substances of interest with the help of solid-phase microextraction ( SPME). Then the compounds can be released into the gas chromatograph for analysis. To make the analysis of low-volatility compounds easier, they can be treated to be more volatile with the help of derivatization.\n\nIn derivatization, a boiling-point-lowering chemical group such as methyl or silyl is attached to a low-volatility compound. For the examination of samples that contain significant amounts of non-volatile matter, the so-called Headspace ( HS) autosampler, which dispenses gas into the gas chromatograph from the top of the actual test sample, can be used. This makes it possible to analyze volatile compounds originating from non-volatile samples, such as soil or construction materials.\n\nAnother option is starting the analysis with pyrolysis, i.e. breaking the sample through exposure to heat. The resulting py-GC-MS analysis is well-suited for analyzing polymeric materials, lignin, and other complex sample types. A GC-MS setup may also be connected to a thermogravimetric analyzer to analyze the evolved gases that are formed when the sample is heated.\n\nNeed an analysis?\n\nAt Measurlabs, we offer a comprehensive selection of purity and composition analyses using GC-MS and related methods, such as GC-ECD and GC-FID. Do not hesitate to contact us through the form below to discuss your testing needs. Our experts will get back to you within one business day.", "Sample preparation methods for GC-MS Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) sample preparation is performed on smaller and more volatile samples including environmental pollutants, industrial byproducts, food contaminants, pesticides, and metabolites of illicit and designer drugs. These molecules are more challenging to ionize and separate (i.e., resolve) using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and so are subjected to GC-MS instead.\n\nGC-MS sample preparation can sometimes occur using LC-MS, as the following figure shows. Furthermore, advances in GC-MS technology, such as the introduction of the Orbitrap mass analyzer, have enabled analysis of larger and more complex compounds, propelling GC-MS into traditional LC-MS fields such as metabolomics.\n\nGas chromatography (GC) is first employed to volatize the sample, after which is it injected into the mobile phase, which is typically composed of a gas such as helium or argon. This mobile phase \u201ccarries\u201d the sample until the stationary phase inside the GC column is reached. This stationary phase often consists of a chemical that is formulated to preferentially interact with select sample compounds. Once at the stationary phase, the GC sample separates. This occurs because the GC column is ramped, or gradually heated, and compounds with lower boiling points are eluted first. Likewise, the pressure of the mobile phase can be varied to fine-tune separation. Finally, there are the chemical interactions between the sample compounds and the stationary phase to consider; weaker interactions will dissociate faster and elute earlier than stronger ones. A compound can be measured from the time of its injection until the time of its elution from the GC column; this is called the compound\u2019s retention time. Lower molecular weight compounds will elute from a GC column sooner than those with a higher molecular weight because of boiling point differences. After this process of elution is complete, compounds undergo electron ionization (EI) or chemical ionization (CI) and become charged. They then undergo mass analysis within a mass spectrometer, and their unique mass (m) and charge (z) information is reported as numerical m/z ratios. Once these values are reported, they are typically displayed as ion peaks. The values are also compared against previously compiled libraries of known mass spectra using analytical software programs. Matching spectra are identified and characterized. Mass spectrometry analysis enables the determination of compound molecular weight and formula, as well as functional groups.\n\nGC-MS sample preparation protocols\n\nGC-MS samples often contain dirty, labile, and volatile compounds that sometimes need further processing before they are introduced into the gas chromatograph. Different manual and automated sample extraction processes are often used prior to gas chromatography, and will differ based on the degree of selectivity required during sample preparation as well as the initial cleanliness of the samples.\n\nFiltration/Dilute and shoot\n\nProtein precipitation\n\nPhospholipid depletion\n\nNon-selective SPE (hydrophobic only)\n\nLiquid-liquid extraction\n\nC18 silica based SPE\n\nC8 silica based SPE\n\nC2 silica based SPE\n\nSupported liquid extraction (SLE)\n\nMixed-mode SPE\n\nIon exchange SPE\n\nImmunoaffinity, MIPs\n\nHeadspace sampling: In this technique, the liquid or solid sample is added to a glass vial until it establishes equilibrium. Some of the analytes vaporize from the liquid or solid and enter the headspace above the sample. If this gas phase is then directly injected into the gas chromatograph for separation, the method is referred to as static headspace sampling. If an inert gas is passed into the sample and the vaporized analytes accumulate on an absorbant surface or cryogenic trap, the method is termed dynamic headspace sampling or purge and trap. This method of analysis is often used with blood, cosmetics, plastics, solid, and materials with high water content. Pyrolysis: This step is performed prior to GC-MS and involves heating samples to 120 C in either an inert environment or in air, resulting in their breakdown to smaller fragments. Samples that typically undergo pyrolysis include plastics, paints, dyes, resins, cellulose, wood, oils, and rubber, as well as larger samples that might be heavily crosslinked or insoluble. Because pyrolysis negates the need to use solvents, it is useful for identification of additives, solvents, and additives.\n\nSolid phase extraction (SPE): This manual extraction technique typically involves the use of a solid packing material, often contained within a cartridge, to separate sample components, remove interferences, or fractionate the sample matrix. The sample itself will typically (although not always) be in liquid form. Samples frequently extracted via SPE include biological samples such as urine, saliva, and plasma, environmental samples such as water, and food products such as beverages.\n\nSolvent extraction: Many analytes, such as pesticides, are highly polar and therefore amenable to extraction with solvents such as acetonitrile. Upon addition of salts such as magnesium sulfate, phase separation of acetonitrile from water occurs. This is the guiding principle behind the QuEChERS technology. Solid phase micro extraction (SPME): Used before both gas chromatography or HPLC, SPME is a sample extraction technique that does not use solvent. Instead, a fused silica fiber, which is coated with a stationary (polymer) phase, is added to the sample. This fiber can be exposed to the vapor phase (headspace) above the liquid or solid or immersed into the liquid sample directly. The analyte(s) of interest diffuse onto the stationary phase; afterwards, the fiber is placed into the injection port of the GC-MS system and the analytes are transferred to the analytical column after thermal desorption. SPME is a fast and simple process that has obvious advantages for field application work. It is frequently used on high background samples such as food. Stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE): This method consists of exposing a magnetic stirring rod that is coated with a sorptive layer to the sample. Following exposure, the bar is removed, rinsed with deionized water, and dried. It is then placed inside the desorber tube and undergoes thermal desorption. During this process, the analytes are transferred onto the chromatographic system. SBSE has the advantage of higher sensitivity due to the larger amount of sorptive phase used; the trade-off is a longer extraction time and mostly manual procedure. The following sample preparation protocols enable faster throughput and lowered costs as a result of automation: Automated SPE: Automated extraction systems can process many SPE samples in just a few hours, enabling quick analysis of compounds of interest including pesticides, flame retardants, semivolatiles, nitrosamines, and steroids. Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE): Automated batch sample processing of solids and semi-solid samples including pesticides, oils, nutritional supplements, and biofuels is frequently accomplished using automated extraction systems. In this way, compounds are quickly extracted from the sample using a minimum amount of time, solvent, and overall cost.\n\nThe following SPE columns offer a range of phases for the retention of polar, non-polar, ionic, and non-ionic compounds.\n\nGC-MS column types\n\nGas chromatography is used to separate sample components and remove background contamination prior to mass spectrometry. Columns are typically made of metal or fused silica and coated with a variety of liquid films; the liquid film is called the stationary phase. Packed columns, which are composed of metal or glass, can also be used in GC. The type of column and stationary phase used will differ depending on sample polarity and charge. GC-MS samples can be polar, nonpolar, or polarizable. They can also be non-ionic or ionic. Going with the idea that \u201clike isolates like,\u201d columns that closely match the characteristics of the analyte should be chosen. Polar GC Columns are designed for the separation of polar samples including alcohols, fatty acids, solvents, flavor compounds, aromatic isomers, herbicides and essential oils. Mid-Polar GC Columns are intended for the separation of chlorinated and nitroaromatic compounds, hydrocarbons, polychlorophenyls (PCBs), drugs of abuse, pesticides, and essential oils. Low-Polar GC Columns are composed of stationary phases such as 5% diphenyl/95% dimethyl polysiloxane and are commonly used to separate alcohols, phenols, aromatics, solvents, pesticides, amines, and free fatty acids. Non-Polar GC Columns can be used in the separation of hydrocarbons, pesticides, essential oils, gasoline range organics (GROs), drugs of abuse, and refinery gases. Ultrafast GC Columns are used in the separation of petrochemicals, flavorings, fragrances, ketones, alcohols, volatiles. PLOT Columns are used to separate alkanes, hydrocarbon isomers, natural and refinery gases, and oxygenated compounds and solvents. Application-specific Columns are used in the retention and analysis of specific compounds and metabolites including pollutants, dioxins, pesticides, herbicides, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), amphetamines, codeine, morphine, and THC.\n\nFeatured resources"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_196ba0ee-264b-4c89-9961-b7a222e367b4"}

Educational attainment: The level of education completed by individuals is a strong predictor of their income and employability, which in turn affects poverty levels[3]. Higher educational attainment generally leads to higher incomes and a lower likelihood of being in poverty [4]. Literacy and numeracy skills: These foundational skills are crucial for individuals to access better job opportunities and participate in the labor market, ultimately contributing to poverty reduction [5]. High literacy and numeracy rates are often associated with low poverty rates [6]. Access and enrollment rates: Evaluating the access to education and enrollment rates in primary, secondary, and tertiary education provides insights into the extent to which the population is engaged in the education system[7]. Higher access and enrollment rates contribute to higher human capital development, promoting economic growth, and reducing poverty [8]. Quality of education: The effectiveness of education in reducing poverty depends on the quality of education provided[9]. Assessing the quality of education includes examining factors such as teacher qualifications, school infrastructure, and student performance [10]. Improved education quality leads to better learning outcomes and can enhance employability and income potential, reducing poverty [11]. Education and income distribution: Education can impact income distribution and inequality, which in turn affects poverty levels[12]. By examining the relationship between education attainment and income distribution, researchers can identify the extent to which education helps reduce income disparities and, consequently, poverty [13]. Economic growth: The impact of education on poverty can also be assessed through its contribution to economic growth[14]. A more educated workforce is generally more productive, resulting in higher economic growth, which can lead to lower poverty levels [15].

Superpowers assume dominant positions on the world stage and are characterized by their ability to exert influence or project power (or aid) on a global scale. The economic, military, and foreign policies of superpowers are watched closely by other countries and can greatly impact the rest of the world. Britannica insightfully defines a superpower as \"a state that cannot be ignored on the world stage and without whose cooperation no world problem can be solved.\"\n\nCountries that are Superpowers in 2022\n\nThe term \u201cglobal superpowers\u201d first appeared after World War II and was applied to the United States and the Soviet Union. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. dominated world affairs during the Cold War, and neither made a move without considering the reaction of the other (hence Britannica's reference to cooperation). Some experts argue that only the U.S. remained a superpower after the Soviet Union dissolved/downsized to become Russia in the early 1990s. Today, opinions differ as to whether the U.S. remains the only global superpower or whether it is one of a small, select group of superpowers.\n\nThe United States\n\nThe United States is the one country today whose global superpower status is indisputed. In fact, some experts argue that the U.S. is currently the world's only true superpower. The U.S. is the world\u2019s most dominant military and economic power, with a military budget of US$778 billion for 2020 and a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$20.9 trillion. The United States spends more on defense than the next nine highest-spending countries (China, India, Russia, the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Germany, France, Japan, and South Korea) combined.\n\nThe U.S. also has strong economic growth capacity. According to Tufts University political scientist Michael Beckley, long-term economic growth depends upon a country's geography, demography (people), and political institutions, and the United States is better-positions than competing powers in all three categories, being \"big (geographically), young, and highly educated\" with a healthier government than competing superpowers.\n\nGiven its strengths, some experts argue that the United States' greatest vulnerability is possible decay from within, particularly given the current highly divided political climate. An example of this division is the Presidency of Donald Trump, whose actions on immigration, foreign policy, trade, and military strategy were often viewed as less cooperative than those of previous administrations, and garnered significant attention\u2014and often criticism\u2014even from the United States\u2019 closest allies. Some of the most impactful moves made during Trump's tenure included withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, banning citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., leaving the Paris climate accord, and conducting military actions including a January 2020 drone strike on Iran.\n\nTrump's successor, President Joe Biden, has walked back many of Trump's foreign policy changes and decisions. For instance, Biden lifted the \"Muslim ban\", canceled Trump's planned withdrawal from the World Health Organization, and rejoined the Paris climate accord in 2021.\n\nChina\n\nChina is considered to be an emerging superpower or a potential superpower. Some experts argue that China will pass the United States as a global superpower in the coming decades. China\u2019s 2020 GDP was US$14.7 trillion, the second-highest in the world. It is also the most populous country in the world. While China\u2019s defense spending is significantly lower than that of the United States at $252 billion, it is still the second-highest in the world. Additionally, China continues to gain ground on the world stage: increasing its diplomatic reach, rising to become one of the largest contributors to the global economy, and pushing technological advances\u2014especially in artificial intelligence (AI) and green technology.\n\nThat said, China must overcome some significant hurdles in its path. Its population is large, but rapidly aging and highly undereducated, with more than 2/3 of its workers lacking a high-school education. The sheer number of Chinese citizens puts a constant strain on the country's resources, and pollution and malnutrition are ongoing concerns. The Chinese government is also often cited as a hindrance to growth due to its deep corruption and willingness to sacrifice economic growth and the personal advancement of its citizens in order to maintain control.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nThe European Union (EU) is considered to be an emerging superpower by many scholars. However, the EU's progress toward becoming a global superpower has been greatly hampered, first by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2008 to 2012 and then by \"Brexit\", in which the United Kingdom officially left the EU in 2020. The EU\u2019s 2020 GDP was 15.2 trillion, larger than China's. Although the EU lacks a combined army as of 2022, several of its members, such as Germany, the UK, and France, have very substantial military capabilities.\n\nDespite these strengths, some experts argue that the EU might not be sustainable with so many member nations, each with its own unique economic and political interests and priorities. Additionally, the EU lacks a unified foreign policy and cannot (as of 2022) effectively project military power worldwide.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia is a potential global superpower. India is the world\u2019s second-most populous nation and is expected to pass China\u2019s population by 2025. India has matched its growing population with significant economic growth and has the largest and youngest workforce in the world.\n\nIndia has also built up its military to secure its borders from potentially hostile neighbors such as Pakistan and China. The Indian military boasts about 100 nuclear warheads and two aircraft carriers (with a third on the way), establishing India as one of the few nations in the world that is capable of projecting military influence anywhere. In addition to its growing population, booming economy, and strengthened military force, India also has the third-most billion-dollar start-up businesses in the world, trailing only the U.S. and China.\n\nRussia\n\nWhether Russia is a global superpower in today's world is a matter of some debate, but there is no doubt that its predecessor, the Soviet Union, was absolutely a superpower. Russia is the world\u2019s largest country by landmass, covering most of northern Asia and Eastern Europe and sharing borders with more than a dozen neighboring countries. Russia is also one of the world's leading suppliers of oil, natural gas, and wheat. However, modern Russia is not the same global powerhouse it once was. Its 2020 GDP was only US$1.4 trillion, roughly 10% of China's and less than 7% of the United States GDP. Russia's population is about 145.8 million people but is expected to decrease by as much as 30% over the next 30 years.\n\nWorld leaders, scholars, and journalists often disagree about whether Russia is currently a proven or potential superpower. The late Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, stated in 2009 that Russia is a superpower, citing the waning influence of the U.S. in global affairs. But Matthew Fleischer of the Los Angeles Times argued in 2014 that Russia would only become a superpower if the climate change that is melting the permafrost that currently covers about two-thirds of the country reveals plentiful stores of natural gas, oil, and precious minerals, enabling Russia to control the world\u2019s supply of these resources.\n\nOthers argue that Russia is not even a potential superpower because it has the trade relations of a Third World country, a much smaller GDP than China or the United States, and no highly rated universities, among others things. Russia is also among the poorest countries in Europe in terms of personal income, ranking 10th or 11th depending upon whether one counts the partially-recognized state of Kosovo.\n\nSuperpowers of the future\n\nThe global balance of power is constantly shifting. As such, at least some of today's superpowers will eventually fade as time and change erode their power. When this happens, which countries are most likely to take their place? Management consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers predicts that not only India and China, but also Brazil, Mexico, and Nigeria will emerge as superpowers by the year 2050."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_4eb5d8c5-f8e5-4f78-95e6-72a403ef3833"}

They were Yangi, Suhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imsu, Harsu, Didanu, Hana, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu, and Azarah.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria became subject to the Akkadian Empire, which was ruled by Sargon the Great.\n\nDue to economic decline, internal civil war, and attacks from the barbarian Gutian people, the Akkadian Empire was destroyed.\n\nOLD ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\n\nThe second period in the history of Assyria is the Old Assyrian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria was able to establish colonies in Anatolia and the Levant.\n\nAs a whole, the land of Assyria during this period consisted of a number of city-states and small Semitic-speaking kingdoms.\n\nDuring this period, Assyrian kings established relationships, either as rivals, neighbors, or trading partners, with the Hattians and Hurrians to the north of Anatolia; the Gutian people, the Lullubi, and the Turukkaeans to the east; the Amorites to the west; and other Sumero-Akkadian city-states, including Isin, Kish, Ur, Eshnunna, and Larsa.\n\nSettlements during this period included Assur, Shubat-Enlil, Nineveh, Karum, Karum Kanesh, Ankuwa, and Hattusa.\n\nAshur, head of the Assyrian pantheon, was a deity worshipped mainly in Upper Mesopotamia, including the Old Assyrian Empire.\n\nMIDDLE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\n\nThe third period in the history of Assyria is the period which lies between the fall of the Old Assyrian Empire and the establishment of the New Assyrian Period (also known as the Neo-Assyrian Empire). It is known as the Middle Assyrian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, the Assyrian Empire saw the reigns of many great kings, including Ashur-uballit I, Arik-den-ili, Tukulti-Ninurta I, and Tiglath-Pileser I.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria was able to overthrow the\n\nHurri-Mitanni Empire.\n\nHurri-Mitanni Empire. The Hittites failed to save Mitanni. They later joined forces with the Babylonians to wage an economic war against Assyria, but this resulted in failure.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria was organized and under the firm control of their king, who also functioned as the High Priest of Ashur, the state god.\n\nPriesthood became a major power in Assyrian society.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria became known as a warrior society due to the long wars that happened.\n\nAssyrian free males were obliged to serve in the army for a time. This system was called the ilku-service.\n\nDue to the Bronze Age Collapse, the Dark Age for the entire Near East, North Africa, Asia Minor, Caucasus, the Mediterranean, and the Balkan regions happened.\n\nThe collapse did not affect the Assyrian Empire much, but the death of Ashur-bel-kala resulted in a comparative decline of the empire.\n\nDespite the visible weakness of the empire, as compared to its previous strength, the Assyrian Empire was still an empire with a stable monarchy, a powerful army, and secured borders. Due to these, the empire had leverage over its potential rivals, such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia, Lydia, and Media.\n\nNEO-ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\n\nThe ascension of Adad-nirari II marked the start of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, Assyria was able to maintain a large and thriving rural population.\n\nThe major Assyrian cities during this time included Nineveh, Assur, Kalhu (Calah, Nimrud), Arbela (Erbil), Arrapha (Karka, Kirkuk), Dur-Sharrukin, Imgur-Enlil, Carchemish, Harran, Tushhan, Til-Barsip, Ekallatum, Kanesh, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, Urhai (Edessa), Guzana, Kahat, Amid (Diyarbakir), M\u00e9rida (Mardin, Tabitu, Nuhadra (Dohuk), Ivah, Sepharvaim, Rachae, Purushanda, Sabata, Birtha (Tikrit), Tell Shemshara, Dur-Katlimmu and Shekhna.\n\nWith the rise of Adad-nirari II, Assyria expanded its empire in all directions into Anatolia, Ancient Iran, Levant, and Babylonia.\n\nAshurbanipal II continued this expansion and later moved the capital from Ashur to Kalhu.\n\nAssyria experienced a period of instability and decline after the reign of Adad-nirari III until the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III.\n\nTiglath-Pileser III created the world\u2019s first professional army, and he was able to conquer areas as far as the East Mediterranean.\n\nIn history, Assyria was able to conquer Babylonia, Chaldea, Elam, Media, Persia, Urartu (Armenia), Phoenicia, Aramea/Syria, Phrygia, the Neo-Hittite States, the Hurrian lands, Arabia, Gutium, Israel, Judah, Samarra, Moab, Edom, Corduene, Cilicia, Mannea, and Cyprus.\n\nDOWNFALL\n\nAfter the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire experienced its worst decline.\n\nThe empire experienced brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir, and Sin-shar-ishkun.\n\nDue to the civil wars, several other groups took advantage of the situation and raided Assyrian areas.\n\nPOST-ASSYRIAN EMPIRE\n\nAfter its fall, Assyria came under the rule of the short-lived Median Empire.\n\nSoon after, Assyria was ruled by the Persian Achaemenid Empire.\n\nDuring this time, Assyria got back on its feet and became a major agricultural and administrative center of the empire.\n\nAfter some time, Assyria fell to Alexander the Great, the Macedonian Emperor.\n\nBy 150 BC, Assyria fell under the control of the Parthian Empire.\n\nDuring this period, Christianity arrived in Assyria.\n\nDuring the Christian period, Assyria fell under control of the Sasanian Empire and was invaded by the Mongols.\n\nAssyrians then suffered a number of religiously and ethnically introduced massacres, including the Simele Massacre and World War II.\n\nAssyria Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Assyria across 24 in-depth pages.

Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses beams of energy to kill cancer cells. If you have one area of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, standard radiation therapy with X-rays might be recommended. For people with more areas of cancer, radiation therapy might be done with electron beams, which target the skin and don't affect internal organs. Electron beam radiation is usually applied to all of the skin.\n\nRadiation therapy uses beams of energy to kill cancer cells.

A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a matched donor (allogeneic bone marrow transplant). During a transplant you'll receive chemotherapy drugs to suppress your diseased bone marrow. Then healthy donor cells are infused into your body where they travel to your bones and begin rebuilding your bone marrow.\n\nClinical trials\n\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\n\nLifestyle and home remedies\n\nTaking measures to care for your skin may help relieve symptoms, such as itching, and reduce your risk of infections. Your doctor may give you specific treatments to control itching and manage your infection risk.\n\nIt may also help to:\n\nUse mild, unscented soap. Using a mild soap that doesn't cause additional irritation may help control itchiness.\n\nUsing a mild soap that doesn't cause additional irritation may help control itchiness. Keep skin moisturized.

Ask about bleach baths. Ask your doctor whether it may be helpful for you to take regular bleach baths or soaks to reduce your risk of infections. For a bleach bath, add 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of household bleach, not concentrated bleach, to a 40-gallon (151-liter) bathtub filled with warm water. Measures are for a U.S.-standard-sized tub filled to the overflow drainage holes. Soak for up to 10 minutes two or three times a week. After, rinse with clean water and apply moisturizer.\n\nCoping and support\n\nWith time, you'll find what helps you cope with the uncertainty and distress that comes with a cancer diagnosis. Until then, you may find it helps to:\n\nLearn enough about lymphoma to make decisions about your care. Ask your doctor about your cancer, including your test results, treatment options and, if you like, your prognosis.

Friends and family can provide the practical support you'll need, such as helping take care of your home. And they can serve as emotional support when you feel overwhelmed by cancer. Find someone to talk with. Find a good listener who is willing to listen to you talk about your hopes and fears. This may be a friend or family member. The concern and understanding of a counselor, medical social worker, clergy member or cancer support group also may be helpful. Ask your doctor about support groups in your area. Other sources of information include the National Cancer Institute and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nPreparing for your appointment\n\nStart by making an appointment with your primary care doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.\n\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nWhen you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as not eating before having a specific test. Make a list of:\n\nYour symptoms , including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment\n\n, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment Key personal information , including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history\n\n, including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including the doses\n\nyou take, including the doses Questions to ask your doctor\n\nBring a family member or friend with you, if possible, to help you remember the information you're given.\n\nFor cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's likely causing my symptoms?\n\nOther than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms?\n\nWhat tests do I need?\n\nWhat's the best course of action?\n\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?\n\nI have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n\nAre there restrictions I need to follow?\n\nShould I see a specialist?\n\nAre there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you recommend?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions.\n\nWhat to expect from your doctor\n\nYour doctor is likely to ask you several questions, such as:", "Think you might have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma? See a doctor who has experience with it. You\u2019ll find dermatologists who have experience with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at Find a Dermatologist. Click on \"Filters\". Select \"Any condition\" and choose \"Cutaneous lymphoma.\"\n\nHow do dermatologists diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nBecause the first noticeable signs often appear on the skin, many people see a dermatologist to find out what\u2019s causing their skin problem.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that it takes time to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called CTCL. If your dermatologist believes that you may have a type of this cancer, your dermatologist will:\n\nGive you a complete skin exam, checking your skin for signs like rashes and plaques.\n\nRun blood tests.\n\nPerform a skin biopsy, to check for cancer.\n\nAsk what medications you take.\n\nEarly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be difficult to find because:\n\nA skin biopsy often doesn\u2019t show cancer cells.\n\nBlood tests may not show cancer cells.\n\nThese cancers can look like a common skin condition, such as eczema or psoriasis, so your dermatologist will have to rule out these conditions.\n\nFor these reasons, it\u2019s important to keep all your dermatology appointments. This helps your dermatologist see what\u2019s happening to your skin over time and order medical tests as needed.\n\nIf tests show that you have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the next step is to find the stage of the cancer. Stage tells you and your doctors whether cancer is found only in your skin or has spread to another part of your body.\n\nTo find the stage, you\u2019ll need medical testing. This may include a chest x-ray, CT scan, or other tests.\n\nHow is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated?\n\nTreatment depends on the type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma you have and the stage of the cancer.\n\nPatients who have an early-stage cancer may receive treatment from a dermatologist and sometimes a radiation oncologist (doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation).\n\nAre you taking any medications or supplements? Be sure your doctors know all the medications and supplements you take. Certain ones, including antacids, turmeric, and green tea extract, can prevent treatment from working.\n\nSome patients see a team of doctors. This team may include your dermatologist, a hematologist (doctor who treats blood diseases) or an oncologist (doctor who treats cancer), and a radiation oncologist.\n\nThe goal of treatment is usually to achieve one of the following:\n\nReduce symptoms (aka symptom control) : The goal of this type of treatment is to help you feel better without compromising your quality of life.\n\n\n\nSymptom control is often the goal for patients who have mycosis fungoides, the most common type of CTCL. Mycosis fungoides tends to advance slowly, so symptom control can help you live life with minimal disruptions.\n\nRemission: When cancer goes into remission, signs and symptoms are reduced. Complete remission means that all signs and symptoms of cancer disappear.\n\n\n\nDuring treatment, pain and other possible side effects may reduce your quality of life or leave you less able to perform everyday activities. Keeping the goal of treatment in mind can help get you through this difficult period.\n\nA treatment plan for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may include one or more of the following types of treatment.\n\nTreatment for the skin\n\nTo destroy cancer cells found in the skin, you may apply medication to your skin, have radiation therapy, or get light treatments. Some patients receive a combination of these treatments.\n\nMedication you apply to your skin: This type of treatment can kill cancer cells in the skin as well as relieve swelling and itch. These medications include:\n\nCorticosteroid: When applied to the skin, this medication can treat cancer and help to reduce inflammation. Less inflammation often means less swelling, itch, and pain. Due to possible side effects, it is prescribed to treat small areas of skin.\n\nBexarotene (bex-air-ah-teen) gel and tazarotene (tah-zare-oh-teen) gel: These gels are retinoids used to treat early CTCL. These medications can stop or slow growing cancer cells.\n\nNitrogen mustard gas (mechlorethamine (me-klor-ETH-a-meen) gel: This is chemotherapy that you apply to your skin. It can slow or stop the growing cancer cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this medication to treat the most common type of CTCL, which is mycosis fungoides, in its earliest form.\n\nCarmustine (car-muh-steen) is another chemotherapy medication used to treat CTCL. Patients apply it to the skin with CTCL. It\u2019s usually applied for 12 weeks.\n\nImiquimod (eh-mick-qui-mod): This medication works by stimulating your immune system. It can be effective in treating early-stage CTCL.\n\nLight treatments: Also called phototherapy, this treatment uses a precise, prescribed amount of light to kill cancer cells in the skin.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you typically stand in a device called a light box for a specific amount of time. Some patients take a medication called psoralen before standing in the light box. The medication makes their skin more sensitive to the light. When you take psoralen first, the phototherapy is called PUVA.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you must go to a treatment center that offers phototherapy. This could be in your dermatologist\u2019s office or a hospital.\n\nLight treatments are typically given 2 to 3 times per week. Most patients need about 20 to 30 light treatments to know whether this treatment is effective.\n\nFor many people who have a darker skin tone and light spots on their skin caused by this cancer, phototherapy can put the cancer in remission (reduce symptoms). Phototherapy can also return lost color.\n\nFor patients with early cancer, phototherapy may be their only treatment. Sometimes, phototherapy and medication applied to the skin are used to treat early cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy: This is often part of a treatment plan for CTCL. Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\nIt can be quite effective for clearing CTCL on the skin. It may be used to get rid of plaques and other signs of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that don't clear with phototherapy. Some patients have a complete response (no sign of cancer) after receiving radiation therapy.\n\nRadiation can be prescribed to treat only certain areas of the skin or the entire body. One type, electron beam radiation therapy, sends radiation only to the outer layers of the skin.\n\nFor patients with advanced cancer, radiation therapy may be prescribed to help them feel better. For example, slowing or shrinking tumors can help ease pain and discomfort caused by advanced cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy is given at a treatment center or hospital.\n\nMedication that works throughout the body: Several of these medications are used to treat the different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here are different types of medications that work throughout the body that may be used to treat CTCL:\n\nTargeted therapy: This type of cancer medication works by targeting specific areas on cancer cells that help the cancer grow and survive.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved brentuximab vedotin (bren-tux-eh-mab veh-dough-tin) ( Adcetris\u00ae ) to treat patients who have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma called systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and some patients with advanced mycosis fungoides.\n\n\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is designed to attach to the surface of cancer cells and deliver vedotin to kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nFor brentuximab vedotin, treatment is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. Patients receive an infusion once every 3 weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nTargeted immunotherapy: This type of medication targets cancerous T-cells in your body and then helps your immune system find and kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one targeted immunotherapy medication, mogamulizumab-kpkc (moe-gam-eh-liz-u-mab) ( Poteligeo\u00ae ), to treat adults who have tried at least one other treatment for mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome, only to find that the cancer came back.\n\n\n\nMogamulizumab-kpkc is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. The infusions are usually given once a week for four weeks, and then once every two weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nHDAC inhibitor: This type of medication can stop or kill cancer cells. The FDA has approved two of these medications to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Romidepsin (row-muh-dep-sin) ( Istodax\u00ae ) is approved to treat people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and have received at least one other medication that works throughout the body. Romidepsin works by slowing the growth of cancer cells. This medication is given intravenously (by IV), so a nurse or other medical professional will treat you. Each treatment takes at least 4 hours, and you receive treatment once a week. Vorinostat [vaw-ree-no-stat] (Zolinza\u00ae ) is approved to treat people whose disease has not improved, worsened, or comes back after taking other medications. It can kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n\n\n\nIf vorinostat is prescribed, you\u2019ll take a capsule, usually with food. Your doctor will tell you how often to take it. Be sure to take this medication exactly as prescribed. If you have any questions about how to take it, ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\nOral retinoids: This type of medication has been used for years to treat CTCL. It can stop the growth of cancer cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one oral retinoid, bexarotene (bek-sr-ow-teen), to treat the tumors and other signs of CTCL on the skin. Due to possible side effects, patients must have tried at least one other medication that works throughout the body before they are prescribed this retinoid.\n\nChemotherapy: Methotrexate (meth-oh-trex-ate) is a chemotherapy medication used to treat many different cancers, When prescribed to treat CTCL, methotrexate is used to slow down or stop tumors and plaques from growing on the skin.\n\nInterferon: Our bodies naturally produce interferon. It\u2019s part of the immune system\u2019s response. Pharmaceutical companies also make synthetic interferon. This interferon is used to treat the most common types of CTCL, mycosis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome.\n\nClinical trial: If you have advanced CTCL, a clinical trial may be your preferred treatment.\n\nA clinical trial is a research study. It allows scientists to find out how well a new medication or other treatment can treat or prevent a disease. Many of today\u2019s medications and other treatments would not exist without clinical trials. There are benefits and risks to joining a clinical trial.\n\nWhile your doctor can give you information about a clinical trial, only you can decide whether one is right for you.\n\nPhotopheresis: Also called extracorporeal photopheresis, this is a procedure. It\u2019s meant to help your immune system fight cancer.\n\nThis procedure begins with a blood draw. The blood taken from your body is placed into a machine that separates your white blood cells from the rest of your blood.\n\nYour white blood cells are then exposed to UVA light after being treated with a medication that makes them more sensitive to light. Your treated white blood cells are then returned to your body.\n\nPatients need to undergo this procedure about 6 to 9 times before the effects are seen.\n\nSurgery: Your doctor may recommend this treatment to remove tumors or other growths on your skin.\n\nStem cell transplant: This treatment is also called a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant. Younger patients may be considered for this treatment if they have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that:\n\nIs advanced\n\nHas come back after treatment\n\nThis is an aggressive treatment. To have a stem cell transplant, you must have a donor who can give you healthy blood-making cells. You must also be physically and emotionally able to undergo the transplant.\n\nA stem cell transplant occurs in two phases. During the first phase, you receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy that damages or destroys your bone marrow. That\u2019s where many blood cells are made.\n\nDuring the transplant phase, your damaged or destroyed bone marrow is replaced with healthy bone marrow from your donor. The goal of this transplant is to allow your body to make healthy, new blood cells, including T-cells.\n\nWait-and-see approach: If you have an early-stage, slowly growing type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma like mycosis fungoides, the best approach may be to watch it rather than treat it. Cancers like mycosis fungoides can remain the same for years. You\u2019ll need to see your doctor regularly so that your doctor can watch you. Keep every appointment.\n\nDermatologists care for patients\u2019 skin during treatment\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with CTCL, you may see a dermatologist for:\n\nSkin problems caused by treatment: Some treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can lead to skin problems or skin disease. For example, retinoids can cause intensely dry skin. Dermatologists treat this dryness with moisturizers and emollients (skin softeners). Sunscreen is used to protect your skin from the sun. Retinoids make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\nDermatologists also treat skin reactions caused by treatment with nitrogen mustard gas.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking certain medication, your dermatologist will also check for skin diseases like skin cancer, vitiligo, and non-cancerous skin growths. Vitiligo, which causes the skin to lose some of its natural skin color, usually goes away on its own once you stop the treatment causing it.\n\nIf you develop skin cancer or non-cancerous skin growths, your dermatologist can treat these.\n\nOpen wounds: If you have tumors or thick patches (plaques) on your skin, these can break open causing wounds. These open wounds require expert medical care.\n\nSkin infections: People with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma have a greater risk of developing skin infections. When tumors or other signs of cancer cover much of your skin, skin infections tend to be common. Skin infections also develop when you have open wounds or scratch frequently.\n\nSome patients who have advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma die of an infection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be under the care of a board-certified dermatologist.\n\nA dermatologist can create a treatment plan to treat the infection. Treatment will include medication and self-care techniques for bathing and sun protection.\n\nItchy skin: Itch is often the most bothersome symptom. It\u2019s estimated that between 60% and 80% of people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are bothered by itch.\n\nYour dermatologist can relieve the itch by prescribing medication that you apply to your skin, wet dressings, or an antihistamine.\n\nIf you have advanced cancer, treating the cancer is often the only way to relieve the itch.\n\nYour dermatologist will also talk with you about caring for your skin at home. The right skin care can help you feel better. More importantly, it can reduce your risk of developing a serious and sometimes life-threatening skin problem.\n\nTo find the skin care that dermatologists recommend, go to: Relief for skin problems related to Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nImages\n\nGetty Images\n\nReferences\n\nBaggot M, Stadler R. \u201cCutaneous lymphoma.\u201d In: Kang S, et al.

A procedure to cut away a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) is usually needed to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The skin might be cut with a circular tool (punch biopsy). For larger lesions and tumors the biopsy might be done with a small knife (excisional biopsy). A doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and tissue (pathologist) examines the sample in a lab to determine whether it contains cancer cells. Sometimes multiple skin biopsies are necessary to confirm your diagnosis. Advanced lab tests to analyze the tissue might uncover clues about your cancer that will help your doctor understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.\n\nImaging tests. If there's concern that the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-related health concerns Start Here\n\nTreatment\n\nMany treatments are available for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Make a list of:\n\nYour symptoms , including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment\n\n, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment Key personal information , including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history\n\n, including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including the doses\n\nyou take, including the doses Questions to ask your doctor\n\nBring a family member or friend with you, if possible, to help you remember the information you're given.\n\nFor cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's likely causing my symptoms?\n\nOther than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms?\n\nWhat tests do I need?\n\nWhat's the best course of action?\n\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?\n\nI have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n\nAre there restrictions I need to follow?\n\nShould I see a specialist?\n\nAre there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you recommend?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions.\n\nWhat to expect from your doctor\n\nYour doctor is likely to ask you several questions, such as:", "Think you might have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma? See a doctor who has experience with it. You\u2019ll find dermatologists who have experience with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at Find a Dermatologist. Click on \"Filters\". Select \"Any condition\" and choose \"Cutaneous lymphoma.\"\n\nHow do dermatologists diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nBecause the first noticeable signs often appear on the skin, many people see a dermatologist to find out what\u2019s causing their skin problem.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that it takes time to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called CTCL. If your dermatologist believes that you may have a type of this cancer, your dermatologist will:\n\nGive you a complete skin exam, checking your skin for signs like rashes and plaques.\n\nRun blood tests.\n\nPerform a skin biopsy, to check for cancer.\n\nAsk what medications you take.\n\nEarly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be difficult to find because:\n\nA skin biopsy often doesn\u2019t show cancer cells.\n\nBlood tests may not show cancer cells.\n\nThese cancers can look like a common skin condition, such as eczema or psoriasis, so your dermatologist will have to rule out these conditions.\n\nFor these reasons, it\u2019s important to keep all your dermatology appointments. This helps your dermatologist see what\u2019s happening to your skin over time and order medical tests as needed.\n\nIf tests show that you have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the next step is to find the stage of the cancer. Stage tells you and your doctors whether cancer is found only in your skin or has spread to another part of your body.\n\nTo find the stage, you\u2019ll need medical testing. This may include a chest x-ray, CT scan, or other tests.\n\nHow is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated?\n\nTreatment depends on the type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma you have and the stage of the cancer.\n\nPatients who have an early-stage cancer may receive treatment from a dermatologist and sometimes a radiation oncologist (doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation).\n\nAre you taking any medications or supplements? Be sure your doctors know all the medications and supplements you take. Certain ones, including antacids, turmeric, and green tea extract, can prevent treatment from working.\n\nSome patients see a team of doctors. This team may include your dermatologist, a hematologist (doctor who treats blood diseases) or an oncologist (doctor who treats cancer), and a radiation oncologist.\n\nThe goal of treatment is usually to achieve one of the following:\n\nReduce symptoms (aka symptom control) : The goal of this type of treatment is to help you feel better without compromising your quality of life.\n\n\n\nSymptom control is often the goal for patients who have mycosis fungoides, the most common type of CTCL. Mycosis fungoides tends to advance slowly, so symptom control can help you live life with minimal disruptions.\n\nRemission: When cancer goes into remission, signs and symptoms are reduced. Complete remission means that all signs and symptoms of cancer disappear.\n\n\n\nDuring treatment, pain and other possible side effects may reduce your quality of life or leave you less able to perform everyday activities. Keeping the goal of treatment in mind can help get you through this difficult period.\n\nA treatment plan for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may include one or more of the following types of treatment.\n\nTreatment for the skin\n\nTo destroy cancer cells found in the skin, you may apply medication to your skin, have radiation therapy, or get light treatments. Some patients receive a combination of these treatments.\n\nMedication you apply to your skin: This type of treatment can kill cancer cells in the skin as well as relieve swelling and itch. These medications include:\n\nCorticosteroid: When applied to the skin, this medication can treat cancer and help to reduce inflammation. Less inflammation often means less swelling, itch, and pain. Due to possible side effects, it is prescribed to treat small areas of skin.\n\nBexarotene (bex-air-ah-teen) gel and tazarotene (tah-zare-oh-teen) gel: These gels are retinoids used to treat early CTCL. These medications can stop or slow growing cancer cells.\n\nNitrogen mustard gas (mechlorethamine (me-klor-ETH-a-meen) gel: This is chemotherapy that you apply to your skin. It can slow or stop the growing cancer cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this medication to treat the most common type of CTCL, which is mycosis fungoides, in its earliest form.\n\nCarmustine (car-muh-steen) is another chemotherapy medication used to treat CTCL. Patients apply it to the skin with CTCL. It\u2019s usually applied for 12 weeks.\n\nImiquimod (eh-mick-qui-mod): This medication works by stimulating your immune system. It can be effective in treating early-stage CTCL.\n\nLight treatments: Also called phototherapy, this treatment uses a precise, prescribed amount of light to kill cancer cells in the skin.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you typically stand in a device called a light box for a specific amount of time. Some patients take a medication called psoralen before standing in the light box. The medication makes their skin more sensitive to the light. When you take psoralen first, the phototherapy is called PUVA.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you must go to a treatment center that offers phototherapy. This could be in your dermatologist\u2019s office or a hospital.\n\nLight treatments are typically given 2 to 3 times per week. Most patients need about 20 to 30 light treatments to know whether this treatment is effective.\n\nFor many people who have a darker skin tone and light spots on their skin caused by this cancer, phototherapy can put the cancer in remission (reduce symptoms). Phototherapy can also return lost color.\n\nFor patients with early cancer, phototherapy may be their only treatment. Sometimes, phototherapy and medication applied to the skin are used to treat early cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy: This is often part of a treatment plan for CTCL. Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\nIt can be quite effective for clearing CTCL on the skin. It may be used to get rid of plaques and other signs of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that don't clear with phototherapy. Some patients have a complete response (no sign of cancer) after receiving radiation therapy.\n\nRadiation can be prescribed to treat only certain areas of the skin or the entire body. One type, electron beam radiation therapy, sends radiation only to the outer layers of the skin.\n\nFor patients with advanced cancer, radiation therapy may be prescribed to help them feel better. For example, slowing or shrinking tumors can help ease pain and discomfort caused by advanced cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy is given at a treatment center or hospital.\n\nMedication that works throughout the body: Several of these medications are used to treat the different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here are different types of medications that work throughout the body that may be used to treat CTCL:\n\nTargeted therapy: This type of cancer medication works by targeting specific areas on cancer cells that help the cancer grow and survive.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved brentuximab vedotin (bren-tux-eh-mab veh-dough-tin) ( Adcetris\u00ae ) to treat patients who have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma called systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and some patients with advanced mycosis fungoides.\n\n\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is designed to attach to the surface of cancer cells and deliver vedotin to kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nFor brentuximab vedotin, treatment is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. Patients receive an infusion once every 3 weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nTargeted immunotherapy: This type of medication targets cancerous T-cells in your body and then helps your immune system find and kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one targeted immunotherapy medication, mogamulizumab-kpkc (moe-gam-eh-liz-u-mab) ( Poteligeo\u00ae ), to treat adults who have tried at least one other treatment for mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome, only to find that the cancer came back.\n\n\n\nMogamulizumab-kpkc is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. The infusions are usually given once a week for four weeks, and then once every two weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nHDAC inhibitor: This type of medication can stop or kill cancer cells. The FDA has approved two of these medications to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Romidepsin (row-muh-dep-sin) ( Istodax\u00ae ) is approved to treat people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and have received at least one other medication that works throughout the body. Romidepsin works by slowing the growth of cancer cells. This medication is given intravenously (by IV), so a nurse or other medical professional will treat you. Each treatment takes at least 4 hours, and you receive treatment once a week. Vorinostat [vaw-ree-no-stat] (Zolinza\u00ae ) is approved to treat people whose disease has not improved, worsened, or comes back after taking other medications. It can kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n\n\n\nIf vorinostat is prescribed, you\u2019ll take a capsule, usually with food. Your doctor will tell you how often to take it. Be sure to take this medication exactly as prescribed. If you have any questions about how to take it, ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\nOral retinoids: This type of medication has been used for years to treat CTCL. It can stop the growth of cancer cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one oral retinoid, bexarotene (bek-sr-ow-teen), to treat the tumors and other signs of CTCL on the skin. Due to possible side effects, patients must have tried at least one other medication that works throughout the body before they are prescribed this retinoid.\n\nChemotherapy: Methotrexate (meth-oh-trex-ate) is a chemotherapy medication used to treat many different cancers, When prescribed to treat CTCL, methotrexate is used to slow down or stop tumors and plaques from growing on the skin.\n\nInterferon: Our bodies naturally produce interferon. It\u2019s part of the immune system\u2019s response. Pharmaceutical companies also make synthetic interferon. This interferon is used to treat the most common types of CTCL, mycosis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome.\n\nClinical trial: If you have advanced CTCL, a clinical trial may be your preferred treatment.\n\nA clinical trial is a research study. It allows scientists to find out how well a new medication or other treatment can treat or prevent a disease. Many of today\u2019s medications and other treatments would not exist without clinical trials. There are benefits and risks to joining a clinical trial.\n\nWhile your doctor can give you information about a clinical trial, only you can decide whether one is right for you.\n\nPhotopheresis: Also called extracorporeal photopheresis, this is a procedure. It\u2019s meant to help your immune system fight cancer.\n\nThis procedure begins with a blood draw. The blood taken from your body is placed into a machine that separates your white blood cells from the rest of your blood.\n\nYour white blood cells are then exposed to UVA light after being treated with a medication that makes them more sensitive to light. Your treated white blood cells are then returned to your body.\n\nPatients need to undergo this procedure about 6 to 9 times before the effects are seen.\n\nSurgery: Your doctor may recommend this treatment to remove tumors or other growths on your skin.\n\nStem cell transplant: This treatment is also called a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant. Younger patients may be considered for this treatment if they have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that:\n\nIs advanced\n\nHas come back after treatment\n\nThis is an aggressive treatment. To have a stem cell transplant, you must have a donor who can give you healthy blood-making cells. You must also be physically and emotionally able to undergo the transplant.\n\nA stem cell transplant occurs in two phases. During the first phase, you receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy that damages or destroys your bone marrow. That\u2019s where many blood cells are made.\n\nDuring the transplant phase, your damaged or destroyed bone marrow is replaced with healthy bone marrow from your donor. The goal of this transplant is to allow your body to make healthy, new blood cells, including T-cells.\n\nWait-and-see approach: If you have an early-stage, slowly growing type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma like mycosis fungoides, the best approach may be to watch it rather than treat it. Cancers like mycosis fungoides can remain the same for years. You\u2019ll need to see your doctor regularly so that your doctor can watch you. Keep every appointment.\n\nDermatologists care for patients\u2019 skin during treatment\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with CTCL, you may see a dermatologist for:\n\nSkin problems caused by treatment: Some treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can lead to skin problems or skin disease. For example, retinoids can cause intensely dry skin. Dermatologists treat this dryness with moisturizers and emollients (skin softeners). Sunscreen is used to protect your skin from the sun. Retinoids make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\nDermatologists also treat skin reactions caused by treatment with nitrogen mustard gas.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking certain medication, your dermatologist will also check for skin diseases like skin cancer, vitiligo, and non-cancerous skin growths. Vitiligo, which causes the skin to lose some of its natural skin color, usually goes away on its own once you stop the treatment causing it.\n\nIf you develop skin cancer or non-cancerous skin growths, your dermatologist can treat these.\n\nOpen wounds: If you have tumors or thick patches (plaques) on your skin, these can break open causing wounds. These open wounds require expert medical care.\n\nSkin infections: People with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma have a greater risk of developing skin infections. When tumors or other signs of cancer cover much of your skin, skin infections tend to be common. Skin infections also develop when you have open wounds or scratch frequently.\n\nSome patients who have advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma die of an infection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be under the care of a board-certified dermatologist.\n\nA dermatologist can create a treatment plan to treat the infection. Treatment will include medication and self-care techniques for bathing and sun protection.\n\nItchy skin: Itch is often the most bothersome symptom. It\u2019s estimated that between 60% and 80% of people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are bothered by itch.\n\nYour dermatologist can relieve the itch by prescribing medication that you apply to your skin, wet dressings, or an antihistamine.\n\nIf you have advanced cancer, treating the cancer is often the only way to relieve the itch.\n\nYour dermatologist will also talk with you about caring for your skin at home. The right skin care can help you feel better. More importantly, it can reduce your risk of developing a serious and sometimes life-threatening skin problem.\n\nTo find the skin care that dermatologists recommend, go to: Relief for skin problems related to Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nImages\n\nGetty Images\n\nReferences\n\nBaggot M, Stadler R. \u201cCutaneous lymphoma.\u201d In: Kang S, et al.

Sometimes cancer cells are found in the blood, particularly with Sezary syndrome. Skin biopsies. A procedure to cut away a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) is usually needed to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The skin might be cut with a circular tool (punch biopsy). For larger lesions and tumors the biopsy might be done with a small knife (excisional biopsy). A doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and tissue (pathologist) examines the sample in a lab to determine whether it contains cancer cells. Sometimes multiple skin biopsies are necessary to confirm your diagnosis. Advanced lab tests to analyze the tissue might uncover clues about your cancer that will help your doctor understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.\n\nImaging tests. If there's concern that the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-related health concerns Start Here\n\nTreatment\n\nMany treatments are available for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a matched donor (allogeneic bone marrow transplant). During a transplant you'll receive chemotherapy drugs to suppress your diseased bone marrow. Then healthy donor cells are infused into your body where they travel to your bones and begin rebuilding your bone marrow.\n\nClinical trials\n\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\n\nLifestyle and home remedies\n\nTaking measures to care for your skin may help relieve symptoms, such as itching, and reduce your risk of infections.

Ask about bleach baths. Ask your doctor whether it may be helpful for you to take regular bleach baths or soaks to reduce your risk of infections. For a bleach bath, add 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of household bleach, not concentrated bleach, to a 40-gallon (151-liter) bathtub filled with warm water. Measures are for a U.S.-standard-sized tub filled to the overflow drainage holes. Soak for up to 10 minutes two or three times a week. After, rinse with clean water and apply moisturizer.\n\nCoping and support\n\nWith time, you'll find what helps you cope with the uncertainty and distress that comes with a cancer diagnosis. Until then, you may find it helps to:\n\nLearn enough about lymphoma to make decisions about your care.

This may include a chest x-ray, CT scan, or other tests.\n\nHow is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated?\n\nTreatment depends on the type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma you have and the stage of the cancer.\n\nPatients who have an early-stage cancer may receive treatment from a dermatologist and sometimes a radiation oncologist (doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation).\n\nAre you taking any medications or supplements? Be sure your doctors know all the medications and supplements you take. Certain ones, including antacids, turmeric, and green tea extract, can prevent treatment from working.\n\nSome patients see a team of doctors. This team may include your dermatologist, a hematologist (doctor who treats blood diseases) or an oncologist (doctor who treats cancer), and a radiation oncologist.\n\nThe goal of treatment is usually to achieve one of the following:\n\nReduce symptoms (aka symptom control) : The goal of this type of treatment is to help you feel better without compromising your quality of life.\n\n\n\nSymptom control is often the goal for patients who have mycosis fungoides, the most common type of CTCL.

Complete remission means that all signs and symptoms of cancer disappear.\n\n\n\nDuring treatment, pain and other possible side effects may reduce your quality of life or leave you less able to perform everyday activities. Keeping the goal of treatment in mind can help get you through this difficult period.\n\nA treatment plan for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may include one or more of the following types of treatment.\n\nTreatment for the skin\n\nTo destroy cancer cells found in the skin, you may apply medication to your skin, have radiation therapy, or get light treatments. Some patients receive a combination of these treatments.\n\nMedication you apply to your skin: This type of treatment can kill cancer cells in the skin as well as relieve swelling and itch. These medications include:\n\nCorticosteroid: When applied to the skin, this medication can treat cancer and help to reduce inflammation. Less inflammation often means less swelling, itch, and pain. Due to possible side effects, it is prescribed to treat small areas of skin.\n\nBexarotene (bex-air-ah-teen) gel and tazarotene (tah-zare-oh-teen) gel: These gels are retinoids used to treat early CTCL. These medications can stop or slow growing cancer cells.\n\nNitrogen mustard gas (mechlorethamine (me-klor-ETH-a-meen) gel: This is chemotherapy that you apply to your skin. It can slow or stop the growing cancer cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this medication to treat the most common type of CTCL, which is mycosis fungoides, in its earliest form.\n\nCarmustine (car-muh-steen) is another chemotherapy medication used to treat CTCL. Patients apply it to the skin with CTCL. It\u2019s usually applied for 12 weeks.\n\nImiquimod (eh-mick-qui-mod): This medication works by stimulating your immune system. It can be effective in treating early-stage CTCL.\n\nLight treatments: Also called phototherapy, this treatment uses a precise, prescribed amount of light to kill cancer cells in the skin.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you typically stand in a device called a light box for a specific amount of time. Some patients take a medication called psoralen before standing in the light box. The medication makes their skin more sensitive to the light. When you take psoralen first, the phototherapy is called PUVA.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you must go to a treatment center that offers phototherapy. This could be in your dermatologist\u2019s office or a hospital.\n\nLight treatments are typically given 2 to 3 times per week. Most patients need about 20 to 30 light treatments to know whether this treatment is effective.\n\nFor many people who have a darker skin tone and light spots on their skin caused by this cancer, phototherapy can put the cancer in remission (reduce symptoms). Phototherapy can also return lost color.\n\nFor patients with early cancer, phototherapy may be their only treatment. Sometimes, phototherapy and medication applied to the skin are used to treat early cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy: This is often part of a treatment plan for CTCL. Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\nIt can be quite effective for clearing CTCL on the skin. It may be used to get rid of plaques and other signs of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that don't clear with phototherapy. Some patients have a complete response (no sign of cancer) after receiving radiation therapy.\n\nRadiation can be prescribed to treat only certain areas of the skin or the entire body. One type, electron beam radiation therapy, sends radiation only to the outer layers of the skin.\n\nFor patients with advanced cancer, radiation therapy may be prescribed to help them feel better. For example, slowing or shrinking tumors can help ease pain and discomfort caused by advanced cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy is given at a treatment center or hospital.\n\nMedication that works throughout the body: Several of these medications are used to treat the different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here are different types of medications that work throughout the body that may be used to treat CTCL:\n\nTargeted therapy: This type of cancer medication works by targeting specific areas on cancer cells that help the cancer grow and survive.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved brentuximab vedotin (bren-tux-eh-mab veh-dough-tin) ( Adcetris\u00ae ) to treat patients who have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma called systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and some patients with advanced mycosis fungoides.\n\n\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is designed to attach to the surface of cancer cells and deliver vedotin to kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nFor brentuximab vedotin, treatment is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. Patients receive an infusion once every 3 weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nTargeted immunotherapy: This type of medication targets cancerous T-cells in your body and then helps your immune system find and kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one targeted immunotherapy medication, mogamulizumab-kpkc (moe-gam-eh-liz-u-mab) ( Poteligeo\u00ae ), to treat adults who have tried at least one other treatment for mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome, only to find that the cancer came back.\n\n\n\nMogamulizumab-kpkc is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. The infusions are usually given once a week for four weeks, and then once every two weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nHDAC inhibitor: This type of medication can stop or kill cancer cells. The FDA has approved two of these medications to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Romidepsin (row-muh-dep-sin) ( Istodax\u00ae ) is approved to treat people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and have received at least one other medication that works throughout the body. Romidepsin works by slowing the growth of cancer cells. This medication is given intravenously (by IV), so a nurse or other medical professional will treat you. Each treatment takes at least 4 hours, and you receive treatment once a week. Vorinostat [vaw-ree-no-stat] (Zolinza\u00ae ) is approved to treat people whose disease has not improved, worsened, or comes back after taking other medications. It can kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n\n\n\nIf vorinostat is prescribed, you\u2019ll take a capsule, usually with food. Your doctor will tell you how often to take it. Be sure to take this medication exactly as prescribed. If you have any questions about how to take it, ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\nOral retinoids: This type of medication has been used for years to treat CTCL. It can stop the growth of cancer cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one oral retinoid, bexarotene (bek-sr-ow-teen), to treat the tumors and other signs of CTCL on the skin. Due to possible side effects, patients must have tried at least one other medication that works throughout the body before they are prescribed this retinoid.\n\nChemotherapy: Methotrexate (meth-oh-trex-ate) is a chemotherapy medication used to treat many different cancers, When prescribed to treat CTCL, methotrexate is used to slow down or stop tumors and plaques from growing on the skin.\n\nInterferon: Our bodies naturally produce interferon. It\u2019s part of the immune system\u2019s response. Pharmaceutical companies also make synthetic interferon. This interferon is used to treat the most common types of CTCL, mycosis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome.\n\nClinical trial: If you have advanced CTCL, a clinical trial may be your preferred treatment.\n\nA clinical trial is a research study. It allows scientists to find out how well a new medication or other treatment can treat or prevent a disease. Many of today\u2019s medications and other treatments would not exist without clinical trials. There are benefits and risks to joining a clinical trial.\n\nWhile your doctor can give you information about a clinical trial, only you can decide whether one is right for you.\n\nPhotopheresis: Also called extracorporeal photopheresis, this is a procedure. It\u2019s meant to help your immune system fight cancer.\n\nThis procedure begins with a blood draw. The blood taken from your body is placed into a machine that separates your white blood cells from the rest of your blood.\n\nYour white blood cells are then exposed to UVA light after being treated with a medication that makes them more sensitive to light. Your treated white blood cells are then returned to your body.\n\nPatients need to undergo this procedure about 6 to 9 times before the effects are seen.\n\nSurgery: Your doctor may recommend this treatment to remove tumors or other growths on your skin.\n\nStem cell transplant: This treatment is also called a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant. Younger patients may be considered for this treatment if they have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that:\n\nIs advanced\n\nHas come back after treatment\n\nThis is an aggressive treatment. To have a stem cell transplant, you must have a donor who can give you healthy blood-making cells. You must also be physically and emotionally able to undergo the transplant.\n\nA stem cell transplant occurs in two phases. During the first phase, you receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy that damages or destroys your bone marrow. That\u2019s where many blood cells are made.\n\nDuring the transplant phase, your damaged or destroyed bone marrow is replaced with healthy bone marrow from your donor. The goal of this transplant is to allow your body to make healthy, new blood cells, including T-cells.\n\nWait-and-see approach: If you have an early-stage, slowly growing type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma like mycosis fungoides, the best approach may be to watch it rather than treat it. Cancers like mycosis fungoides can remain the same for years. You\u2019ll need to see your doctor regularly so that your doctor can watch you. Keep every appointment.\n\nDermatologists care for patients\u2019 skin during treatment\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with CTCL, you may see a dermatologist for:\n\nSkin problems caused by treatment: Some treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can lead to skin problems or skin disease. For example, retinoids can cause intensely dry skin. Dermatologists treat this dryness with moisturizers and emollients (skin softeners). Sunscreen is used to protect your skin from the sun. Retinoids make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\nDermatologists also treat skin reactions caused by treatment with nitrogen mustard gas.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking certain medication, your dermatologist will also check for skin diseases like skin cancer, vitiligo, and non-cancerous skin growths. Vitiligo, which causes the skin to lose some of its natural skin color, usually goes away on its own once you stop the treatment causing it.\n\nIf you develop skin cancer or non-cancerous skin growths, your dermatologist can treat these.\n\nOpen wounds: If you have tumors or thick patches (plaques) on your skin, these can break open causing wounds. These open wounds require expert medical care.\n\nSkin infections: People with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma have a greater risk of developing skin infections. When tumors or other signs of cancer cover much of your skin, skin infections tend to be common. Skin infections also develop when you have open wounds or scratch frequently.\n\nSome patients who have advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma die of an infection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be under the care of a board-certified dermatologist.\n\nA dermatologist can create a treatment plan to treat the infection. Treatment will include medication and self-care techniques for bathing and sun protection.\n\nItchy skin: Itch is often the most bothersome symptom. It\u2019s estimated that between 60% and 80% of people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are bothered by itch.\n\nYour dermatologist can relieve the itch by prescribing medication that you apply to your skin, wet dressings, or an antihistamine.\n\nIf you have advanced cancer, treating the cancer is often the only way to relieve the itch.\n\nYour dermatologist will also talk with you about caring for your skin at home. The right skin care can help you feel better. More importantly, it can reduce your risk of developing a serious and sometimes life-threatening skin problem.\n\nTo find the skin care that dermatologists recommend, go to: Relief for skin problems related to Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nImages\n\nGetty Images\n\nReferences\n\nBaggot M, Stadler R. \u201cCutaneous lymphoma.\u201d In: Kang S, et al.

Sometimes cancer cells are found in the blood, particularly with Sezary syndrome. Skin biopsies. A procedure to cut away a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) is usually needed to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The skin might be cut with a circular tool (punch biopsy). For larger lesions and tumors the biopsy might be done with a small knife (excisional biopsy). A doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and tissue (pathologist) examines the sample in a lab to determine whether it contains cancer cells. Sometimes multiple skin biopsies are necessary to confirm your diagnosis. Advanced lab tests to analyze the tissue might uncover clues about your cancer that will help your doctor understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.\n\nImaging tests. If there's concern that the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-related health concerns Start Here\n\nTreatment\n\nMany treatments are available for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Which treatments are best for you depends on your particular situation, including the extent or stage of your lymphoma. Most people receive a combination of treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nTreatment options may include:\n\nSkin creams and ointments.

A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a matched donor (allogeneic bone marrow transplant). During a transplant you'll receive chemotherapy drugs to suppress your diseased bone marrow. Then healthy donor cells are infused into your body where they travel to your bones and begin rebuilding your bone marrow.\n\nClinical trials\n\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\n\nLifestyle and home remedies\n\nTaking measures to care for your skin may help relieve symptoms, such as itching, and reduce your risk of infections. Your doctor may give you specific treatments to control itching and manage your infection risk.\n\nIt may also help to:\n\nUse mild, unscented soap.

Ask about bleach baths. Ask your doctor whether it may be helpful for you to take regular bleach baths or soaks to reduce your risk of infections. For a bleach bath, add 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of household bleach, not concentrated bleach, to a 40-gallon (151-liter) bathtub filled with warm water. Measures are for a U.S.-standard-sized tub filled to the overflow drainage holes. Soak for up to 10 minutes two or three times a week. After, rinse with clean water and apply moisturizer.\n\nCoping and support\n\nWith time, you'll find what helps you cope with the uncertainty and distress that comes with a cancer diagnosis. Until then, you may find it helps to:\n\nLearn enough about lymphoma to make decisions about your care.

Sometimes cancer cells are found in the blood, particularly with Sezary syndrome. Skin biopsies. A procedure to cut away a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) is usually needed to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The skin might be cut with a circular tool (punch biopsy). For larger lesions and tumors the biopsy might be done with a small knife (excisional biopsy). A doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and tissue (pathologist) examines the sample in a lab to determine whether it contains cancer cells. Sometimes multiple skin biopsies are necessary to confirm your diagnosis. Advanced lab tests to analyze the tissue might uncover clues about your cancer that will help your doctor understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.\n\nImaging tests. If there's concern that the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-related health concerns Start Here\n\nTreatment\n\nMany treatments are available for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Which treatments are best for you depends on your particular situation, including the extent or stage of your lymphoma. Most people receive a combination of treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nTreatment options may include:\n\nSkin creams and ointments. Medicines can be applied to your skin in the form of creams, gels and ointments. Corticosteroids can help control skin redness and itchiness. Chemotherapy can be applied to the skin to attack cancer cells.\n\nMedicines can be applied to your skin in the form of creams, gels and ointments.

Phototherapy involves exposing the skin to wavelengths of light, such as ultraviolet B or ultraviolet A. Various machines are used in phototherapy, including booths that expose most of your body to the light. Sometimes phototherapy is done after the application of a medication that makes skin cells more sensitive to light (photodynamic therapy). Healthy cells regenerate quickly, but cancer cells do not.\n\nPhototherapy involves exposing the skin to wavelengths of light, such as ultraviolet B or ultraviolet A.

Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses beams of energy to kill cancer cells. If you have one area of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, standard radiation therapy with X-rays might be recommended. For people with more areas of cancer, radiation therapy might be done with electron beams, which target the skin and don't affect internal organs. Electron beam radiation is usually applied to all of the skin.\n\nRadiation therapy uses beams of energy to kill cancer cells.

A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a matched donor (allogeneic bone marrow transplant). During a transplant you'll receive chemotherapy drugs to suppress your diseased bone marrow. Then healthy donor cells are infused into your body where they travel to your bones and begin rebuilding your bone marrow.\n\nClinical trials\n\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this condition.\n\nLifestyle and home remedies\n\nTaking measures to care for your skin may help relieve symptoms, such as itching, and reduce your risk of infections. Your doctor may give you specific treatments to control itching and manage your infection risk.\n\nIt may also help to:\n\nUse mild, unscented soap. Using a mild soap that doesn't cause additional irritation may help control itchiness.\n\nUsing a mild soap that doesn't cause additional irritation may help control itchiness. Keep skin moisturized.

Ask about bleach baths. Ask your doctor whether it may be helpful for you to take regular bleach baths or soaks to reduce your risk of infections. For a bleach bath, add 1/2 cup (118 milliliters) of household bleach, not concentrated bleach, to a 40-gallon (151-liter) bathtub filled with warm water. Measures are for a U.S.-standard-sized tub filled to the overflow drainage holes. Soak for up to 10 minutes two or three times a week. After, rinse with clean water and apply moisturizer.\n\nCoping and support\n\nWith time, you'll find what helps you cope with the uncertainty and distress that comes with a cancer diagnosis. Until then, you may find it helps to:\n\nLearn enough about lymphoma to make decisions about your care.

Friends and family can provide the practical support you'll need, such as helping take care of your home. And they can serve as emotional support when you feel overwhelmed by cancer. Find someone to talk with. Find a good listener who is willing to listen to you talk about your hopes and fears. This may be a friend or family member. The concern and understanding of a counselor, medical social worker, clergy member or cancer support group also may be helpful. Ask your doctor about support groups in your area. Other sources of information include the National Cancer Institute and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nPreparing for your appointment\n\nStart by making an appointment with your primary care doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you.\n\nHere's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nWhen you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance, such as not eating before having a specific test. Make a list of:\n\nYour symptoms , including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment\n\n, including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment Key personal information , including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history\n\n, including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history All medications, vitamins or other supplements you take, including the doses\n\nyou take, including the doses Questions to ask your doctor\n\nBring a family member or friend with you, if possible, to help you remember the information you're given.\n\nFor cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:\n\nWhat's likely causing my symptoms?\n\nOther than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms?\n\nWhat tests do I need?\n\nWhat's the best course of action?\n\nWhat are the alternatives to the primary approach you're suggesting?\n\nI have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?\n\nAre there restrictions I need to follow?\n\nShould I see a specialist?\n\nAre there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you recommend?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions.\n\nWhat to expect from your doctor\n\nYour doctor is likely to ask you several questions, such as:", "Think you might have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma? See a doctor who has experience with it. You\u2019ll find dermatologists who have experience with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at Find a Dermatologist. Click on \"Filters\". Select \"Any condition\" and choose \"Cutaneous lymphoma.\"\n\nHow do dermatologists diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nBecause the first noticeable signs often appear on the skin, many people see a dermatologist to find out what\u2019s causing their skin problem.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that it takes time to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called CTCL. If your dermatologist believes that you may have a type of this cancer, your dermatologist will:\n\nGive you a complete skin exam, checking your skin for signs like rashes and plaques.\n\nRun blood tests.\n\nPerform a skin biopsy, to check for cancer.\n\nAsk what medications you take.\n\nEarly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be difficult to find because:\n\nA skin biopsy often doesn\u2019t show cancer cells.\n\nBlood tests may not show cancer cells.\n\nThese cancers can look like a common skin condition, such as eczema or psoriasis, so your dermatologist will have to rule out these conditions.\n\nFor these reasons, it\u2019s important to keep all your dermatology appointments. This helps your dermatologist see what\u2019s happening to your skin over time and order medical tests as needed.\n\nIf tests show that you have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the next step is to find the stage of the cancer. Stage tells you and your doctors whether cancer is found only in your skin or has spread to another part of your body.\n\nTo find the stage, you\u2019ll need medical testing. This may include a chest x-ray, CT scan, or other tests.\n\nHow is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated?\n\nTreatment depends on the type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma you have and the stage of the cancer.\n\nPatients who have an early-stage cancer may receive treatment from a dermatologist and sometimes a radiation oncologist (doctor who specializes in treating cancer with radiation).\n\nAre you taking any medications or supplements? Be sure your doctors know all the medications and supplements you take. Certain ones, including antacids, turmeric, and green tea extract, can prevent treatment from working.\n\nSome patients see a team of doctors. This team may include your dermatologist, a hematologist (doctor who treats blood diseases) or an oncologist (doctor who treats cancer), and a radiation oncologist.\n\nThe goal of treatment is usually to achieve one of the following:\n\nReduce symptoms (aka symptom control) : The goal of this type of treatment is to help you feel better without compromising your quality of life.\n\n\n\nSymptom control is often the goal for patients who have mycosis fungoides, the most common type of CTCL. Mycosis fungoides tends to advance slowly, so symptom control can help you live life with minimal disruptions.\n\nRemission: When cancer goes into remission, signs and symptoms are reduced. Complete remission means that all signs and symptoms of cancer disappear.\n\n\n\nDuring treatment, pain and other possible side effects may reduce your quality of life or leave you less able to perform everyday activities. Keeping the goal of treatment in mind can help get you through this difficult period.\n\nA treatment plan for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma may include one or more of the following types of treatment.\n\nTreatment for the skin\n\nTo destroy cancer cells found in the skin, you may apply medication to your skin, have radiation therapy, or get light treatments. Some patients receive a combination of these treatments.\n\nMedication you apply to your skin: This type of treatment can kill cancer cells in the skin as well as relieve swelling and itch. These medications include:\n\nCorticosteroid: When applied to the skin, this medication can treat cancer and help to reduce inflammation. Less inflammation often means less swelling, itch, and pain. Due to possible side effects, it is prescribed to treat small areas of skin.\n\nBexarotene (bex-air-ah-teen) gel and tazarotene (tah-zare-oh-teen) gel: These gels are retinoids used to treat early CTCL. These medications can stop or slow growing cancer cells.\n\nNitrogen mustard gas (mechlorethamine (me-klor-ETH-a-meen) gel: This is chemotherapy that you apply to your skin. It can slow or stop the growing cancer cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this medication to treat the most common type of CTCL, which is mycosis fungoides, in its earliest form.\n\nCarmustine (car-muh-steen) is another chemotherapy medication used to treat CTCL. Patients apply it to the skin with CTCL. It\u2019s usually applied for 12 weeks.\n\nImiquimod (eh-mick-qui-mod): This medication works by stimulating your immune system. It can be effective in treating early-stage CTCL.\n\nLight treatments: Also called phototherapy, this treatment uses a precise, prescribed amount of light to kill cancer cells in the skin.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you typically stand in a device called a light box for a specific amount of time. Some patients take a medication called psoralen before standing in the light box. The medication makes their skin more sensitive to the light. When you take psoralen first, the phototherapy is called PUVA.\n\nTo receive light treatments, you must go to a treatment center that offers phototherapy. This could be in your dermatologist\u2019s office or a hospital.\n\nLight treatments are typically given 2 to 3 times per week. Most patients need about 20 to 30 light treatments to know whether this treatment is effective.\n\nFor many people who have a darker skin tone and light spots on their skin caused by this cancer, phototherapy can put the cancer in remission (reduce symptoms). Phototherapy can also return lost color.\n\nFor patients with early cancer, phototherapy may be their only treatment. Sometimes, phototherapy and medication applied to the skin are used to treat early cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy: This is often part of a treatment plan for CTCL. Radiation therapy is used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.\n\nIt can be quite effective for clearing CTCL on the skin. It may be used to get rid of plaques and other signs of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that don't clear with phototherapy. Some patients have a complete response (no sign of cancer) after receiving radiation therapy.\n\nRadiation can be prescribed to treat only certain areas of the skin or the entire body. One type, electron beam radiation therapy, sends radiation only to the outer layers of the skin.\n\nFor patients with advanced cancer, radiation therapy may be prescribed to help them feel better. For example, slowing or shrinking tumors can help ease pain and discomfort caused by advanced cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy is given at a treatment center or hospital.\n\nMedication that works throughout the body: Several of these medications are used to treat the different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here are different types of medications that work throughout the body that may be used to treat CTCL:\n\nTargeted therapy: This type of cancer medication works by targeting specific areas on cancer cells that help the cancer grow and survive.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved brentuximab vedotin (bren-tux-eh-mab veh-dough-tin) ( Adcetris\u00ae ) to treat patients who have a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma called systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL) and some patients with advanced mycosis fungoides.\n\n\n\nBrentuximab vedotin is designed to attach to the surface of cancer cells and deliver vedotin to kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nFor brentuximab vedotin, treatment is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. Patients receive an infusion once every 3 weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nTargeted immunotherapy: This type of medication targets cancerous T-cells in your body and then helps your immune system find and kill the cancerous cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one targeted immunotherapy medication, mogamulizumab-kpkc (moe-gam-eh-liz-u-mab) ( Poteligeo\u00ae ), to treat adults who have tried at least one other treatment for mycosis fungoides or S\u00e9zary syndrome, only to find that the cancer came back.\n\n\n\nMogamulizumab-kpkc is given intravenously (by IV), so you\u2019ll need to go to a treatment center that offers infusions. The infusions are usually given once a week for four weeks, and then once every two weeks. How many infusions you receive depends on how your body responds to the medication.\n\nHDAC inhibitor: This type of medication can stop or kill cancer cells. The FDA has approved two of these medications to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Romidepsin (row-muh-dep-sin) ( Istodax\u00ae ) is approved to treat people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and have received at least one other medication that works throughout the body. Romidepsin works by slowing the growth of cancer cells. This medication is given intravenously (by IV), so a nurse or other medical professional will treat you. Each treatment takes at least 4 hours, and you receive treatment once a week. Vorinostat [vaw-ree-no-stat] (Zolinza\u00ae ) is approved to treat people whose disease has not improved, worsened, or comes back after taking other medications. It can kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.\n\n\n\nIf vorinostat is prescribed, you\u2019ll take a capsule, usually with food. Your doctor will tell you how often to take it. Be sure to take this medication exactly as prescribed. If you have any questions about how to take it, ask your pharmacist or doctor.\n\nOral retinoids: This type of medication has been used for years to treat CTCL. It can stop the growth of cancer cells.\n\n\n\nThe FDA has approved one oral retinoid, bexarotene (bek-sr-ow-teen), to treat the tumors and other signs of CTCL on the skin. Due to possible side effects, patients must have tried at least one other medication that works throughout the body before they are prescribed this retinoid.\n\nChemotherapy: Methotrexate (meth-oh-trex-ate) is a chemotherapy medication used to treat many different cancers, When prescribed to treat CTCL, methotrexate is used to slow down or stop tumors and plaques from growing on the skin.\n\nInterferon: Our bodies naturally produce interferon. It\u2019s part of the immune system\u2019s response. Pharmaceutical companies also make synthetic interferon. This interferon is used to treat the most common types of CTCL, mycosis fungoides and S\u00e9zary syndrome.\n\nClinical trial: If you have advanced CTCL, a clinical trial may be your preferred treatment.\n\nA clinical trial is a research study. It allows scientists to find out how well a new medication or other treatment can treat or prevent a disease. Many of today\u2019s medications and other treatments would not exist without clinical trials. There are benefits and risks to joining a clinical trial.\n\nWhile your doctor can give you information about a clinical trial, only you can decide whether one is right for you.\n\nPhotopheresis: Also called extracorporeal photopheresis, this is a procedure. It\u2019s meant to help your immune system fight cancer.\n\nThis procedure begins with a blood draw. The blood taken from your body is placed into a machine that separates your white blood cells from the rest of your blood.\n\nYour white blood cells are then exposed to UVA light after being treated with a medication that makes them more sensitive to light. Your treated white blood cells are then returned to your body.\n\nPatients need to undergo this procedure about 6 to 9 times before the effects are seen.\n\nSurgery: Your doctor may recommend this treatment to remove tumors or other growths on your skin.\n\nStem cell transplant: This treatment is also called a hematopoietic stem cell transplant or bone marrow transplant. Younger patients may be considered for this treatment if they have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that:\n\nIs advanced\n\nHas come back after treatment\n\nThis is an aggressive treatment. To have a stem cell transplant, you must have a donor who can give you healthy blood-making cells. You must also be physically and emotionally able to undergo the transplant.\n\nA stem cell transplant occurs in two phases. During the first phase, you receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy that damages or destroys your bone marrow. That\u2019s where many blood cells are made.\n\nDuring the transplant phase, your damaged or destroyed bone marrow is replaced with healthy bone marrow from your donor. The goal of this transplant is to allow your body to make healthy, new blood cells, including T-cells.\n\nWait-and-see approach: If you have an early-stage, slowly growing type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma like mycosis fungoides, the best approach may be to watch it rather than treat it. Cancers like mycosis fungoides can remain the same for years. You\u2019ll need to see your doctor regularly so that your doctor can watch you. Keep every appointment.\n\nDermatologists care for patients\u2019 skin during treatment\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with CTCL, you may see a dermatologist for:\n\nSkin problems caused by treatment: Some treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can lead to skin problems or skin disease. For example, retinoids can cause intensely dry skin. Dermatologists treat this dryness with moisturizers and emollients (skin softeners). Sunscreen is used to protect your skin from the sun. Retinoids make your skin sensitive to sunlight.\n\nDermatologists also treat skin reactions caused by treatment with nitrogen mustard gas.\n\nIf you\u2019re taking certain medication, your dermatologist will also check for skin diseases like skin cancer, vitiligo, and non-cancerous skin growths. Vitiligo, which causes the skin to lose some of its natural skin color, usually goes away on its own once you stop the treatment causing it.\n\nIf you develop skin cancer or non-cancerous skin growths, your dermatologist can treat these.\n\nOpen wounds: If you have tumors or thick patches (plaques) on your skin, these can break open causing wounds. These open wounds require expert medical care.\n\nSkin infections: People with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma have a greater risk of developing skin infections. When tumors or other signs of cancer cover much of your skin, skin infections tend to be common. Skin infections also develop when you have open wounds or scratch frequently.\n\nSome patients who have advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma die of an infection. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to be under the care of a board-certified dermatologist.\n\nA dermatologist can create a treatment plan to treat the infection. Treatment will include medication and self-care techniques for bathing and sun protection.\n\nItchy skin: Itch is often the most bothersome symptom. It\u2019s estimated that between 60% and 80% of people who have cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are bothered by itch.\n\nYour dermatologist can relieve the itch by prescribing medication that you apply to your skin, wet dressings, or an antihistamine.\n\nIf you have advanced cancer, treating the cancer is often the only way to relieve the itch.\n\nYour dermatologist will also talk with you about caring for your skin at home. The right skin care can help you feel better. More importantly, it can reduce your risk of developing a serious and sometimes life-threatening skin problem.\n\nTo find the skin care that dermatologists recommend, go to: Relief for skin problems related to Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nImages\n\nGetty Images\n\nReferences\n\nBaggot M, Stadler R. \u201cCutaneous lymphoma.\u201d In: Kang S, et al.

It is a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which malignant T-cells are initially localised to the skin with no evidence of extracutaneous disease at the time of diagnosis.\n\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides S\u00e9zary syndrome\n\nWho gets cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma comprises 4% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 75-80% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. It shows a male predominance of 2:1. The incidence of CTCL increases with age, with an average age at diagnosis of 50-60 years.\n\nWhat causes cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nThe aetiopathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is unknown. Theories include a viral infection (eg, Epstein Barr virus, HTLV-1) causing a chronically heightened immune state, genetic changes (eg, HLA type), or chemical exposure (eg, medications).\n\nEpigenetics regulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic studies of CTCL have identified changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNAs and chromatin remodellers. One example is miR-155 which is overexpressed in malignant CTCL cells, especially in advanced stage disease, and treatments inhibiting this are in early clinical trials for tumour-stage mycosis fungoides, S\u00e9zary syndrome, and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.\n\nAn association between JAK inhibitors and malignancy (eg, T-cell lymphomas) is currently under investigation and is not fully understood. There have been rare cases of T-cell lymphomas reported in patients treated with JAK inhibitors, but the overall incidence appears to be low and causality has not been established.\n\nWhat is the classification of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas?\n\nThe 2018 WHO-EORTC classification of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas is summarised in the following tables with links to specific DermNet webpages.\n\nTable 1. Indolent forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n\nIndolent forms of CTCL Frequency (%) Prognosis : 5 year survival (%) Mycosis fungoides 39 88 Mycosis fungoides variants Folliculotropic MF 5 75 Pagetoid reticulosis <1 100 Granulomatous slack skin <1 100 Primary cutaneous CD30+ LPD pcALCL 8 95 Lymphomatoid papulosis 12 99 Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder* 6 100 Subcutaneous panniculitis -like T-cell lymphoma 1 87\n\nTable 2.

Sometimes cancer cells are found in the blood, particularly with Sezary syndrome. Skin biopsies. A procedure to cut away a small sample of skin (skin biopsy) is usually needed to diagnose cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The skin might be cut with a circular tool (punch biopsy). For larger lesions and tumors the biopsy might be done with a small knife (excisional biopsy). A doctor who specializes in analyzing blood and tissue (pathologist) examines the sample in a lab to determine whether it contains cancer cells. Sometimes multiple skin biopsies are necessary to confirm your diagnosis. Advanced lab tests to analyze the tissue might uncover clues about your cancer that will help your doctor understand your prognosis and determine your treatment options.\n\nImaging tests. If there's concern that the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body, your doctor might recommend imaging tests, such as computerized tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\nCare at Mayo Clinic Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-related health concerns Start Here\n\nTreatment\n\nMany treatments are available for people with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Which treatments are best for you depends on your particular situation, including the extent or stage of your lymphoma. Most people receive a combination of treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\nTreatment options may include:\n\nSkin creams and ointments. Medicines can be applied to your skin in the form of creams, gels and ointments. Corticosteroids can help control skin redness and itchiness.

How can I best manage them together?\n\nAre there restrictions I need to follow?\n\nShould I see a specialist?\n\nAre there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you recommend?\n\nDon't hesitate to ask other questions.\n\nWhat to expect from your doctor\n\nYour doctor is likely to ask you several questions, such as:", "What is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ?\n\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is the most common type of primary cutaneous lymphoma. It is a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which malignant T-cells are initially localised to the skin with no evidence of extracutaneous disease at the time of diagnosis.\n\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides S\u00e9zary syndrome\n\nWho gets cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nCutaneous T-cell lymphoma comprises 4% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 75-80% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. It shows a male predominance of 2:1. The incidence of CTCL increases with age, with an average age at diagnosis of 50-60 years.\n\nWhat causes cutaneous T-cell lymphoma?\n\nThe aetiopathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is unknown. Theories include a viral infection (eg, Epstein Barr virus, HTLV-1) causing a chronically heightened immune state, genetic changes (eg, HLA type), or chemical exposure (eg, medications).\n\nEpigenetics regulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenetic studies of CTCL have identified changes in DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNAs and chromatin remodellers. One example is miR-155 which is overexpressed in malignant CTCL cells, especially in advanced stage disease, and treatments inhibiting this are in early clinical trials for tumour-stage mycosis fungoides, S\u00e9zary syndrome, and primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.\n\nAn association between JAK inhibitors and malignancy (eg, T-cell lymphomas) is currently under investigation and is not fully understood. There have been rare cases of T-cell lymphomas reported in patients treated with JAK inhibitors, but the overall incidence appears to be low and causality has not been established.\n\nWhat is the classification of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas?\n\nThe 2018 WHO-EORTC classification of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas is summarised in the following tables with links to specific DermNet webpages.\n\nTable 1.

These differences may impact the comparative advantage of countries, trade costs, and serve as non-tariff barriers to trade[2]. First, differences in regulatory environments can affect the cost of production in various countries[3]. Regulations related to labor standards, environmental protection, and taxation can lead to a higher or lower cost of production for businesses in a given country[4]. This, in turn, can influence the comparative advantage of countries, determining which products they are more efficient at producing and the patterns of their international trade[5]. Second, differing regulations pertaining to quality and safety standards can also impact trade patterns[6]. Countries that impose strict quality and safety standards on their products may enjoy a competitive advantage in exports, as their products are perceived as being more reliable and of higher quality[7]. Conversely, countries with lower standards may face difficulties in exporting their products to more regulated markets, as their products may not meet the required criteria[8]. This can lead to a divergence in trade patterns, as countries with higher standards export more to quality-sensitive markets, while countries with lower standards may struggle to find export markets that accept their products[9]. Third, regulatory differences may serve as non-tariff barriers to trade, inhibiting the flow of goods and services between countries[10]. For instance, some countries may impose strict import regulations, such as quotas, licensing requirements, or customs procedures, making it more difficult for businesses in other countries to access their markets[11]. These barriers, in turn, can affect the volume and distribution of international trade, as well as the composition of exports and imports among countries[12]. In conclusion, differences in regulatory environments play a vital role in shaping the patterns of international trade[13]. They can impact the comparative advantage of countries, influence trade costs, and create non-tariff barriers to trade[14]. Understanding these differences, and their effects on trade patterns, is crucial for policymakers and businesses operating in an increasingly globalized economy[15].", "references": ["[7] https://hbr.org/1990/03/the-competitive-advantage-of-nations\n\ndrive up factor costs or the exchange rate.

In simple terms, Rule 19 provides guidelines for vessels to avoid collisions when they cannot see other vessels due to limited visibility [2]. According to Rule 19, a vessel should proceed at a safe speed suitable for the prevailing visibility conditions, ensure her navigational equipment (such as radar) is functioning properly, and continuously monitor other vessels' movements closely [3]. If a vessel detects another nearby vessel, it must determine if there is a risk of collision[4]. If a risk exists, both vessels should take necessary steps to avoid the collision, such as altering their course or reducing their speed [5]. Furthermore, vessels must not make abrupt course changes, due to the difficulty of detecting another vessel's movement in restricted visibility conditions [6]. Rule 19 also stipulates that if a vessel cannot avoid the risk of collision through her own actions, she should stop her engines and stay put so that the other vessel can take necessary measures to avoid the collision [7].

The primary difference between the two lies in their underlying philosophies, design elements, and materials used[2]. Modern architecture emerged as a response to traditional, heavily ornamented designs and is characterized by clean lines, simple forms, open floor plans, and minimal ornamentation [3]. Influenced by the modernist art movement, it emphasizes function and prioritizes the use of new materials such as steel, glass, and reinforced concrete [4]. Some key examples of modern architecture include the Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier, the Farnsworth House by Mies van der Rohe, and the Case Study Houses by various architects [5].

Within the supply chain, TQM promotes the integration of quality principles and practices across all stages, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and customer service [2]. By implementing TQM, organizations can achieve better supply chain performance and increased competitiveness [3].\n\nSome of the key roles of TQM in supply chain management include:\n\n1. Quality improvement: TQM highlights the importance of continuous improvement in the supply chain processes. This involves identifying problem areas, implementing corrective actions, and monitoring performance regularly to ensure that the desired quality levels are consistently achieved [4].\n\n Customer satisfaction: TQM emphasizes meeting or exceeding customer expectations in terms of product and service quality. By integrating TQM principles into the supply chain, organizations can ensure that the final products are of high quality and delivered on time, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction [5].\n\n Supplier quality management: TQM encourages the development of strong partnerships with suppliers based on mutual trust and the pursuit of quality. Organizations can work collaboratively with their suppliers to identify and resolve issues, share best practices, and establish mutually beneficial quality targets [6].\n\n Employee involvement and training: TQM stresses the importance of employee engagement and training in achieving quality objectives. Encouraging employee involvement and investing in training programs can help organizations develop a quality-driven culture, where every individual is responsible for maintaining and improving supply chain processes [7].\n\n Process optimization: TQM seeks to optimize processes within the supply chain by identifying inefficiencies, waste, and bottlenecks, and then implementing corrective actions. This can lead to reduced lead times, lower costs, and improved overall supply chain performance [8].\n\n Performance measurement: Establishing relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) is an important aspect of TQM in supply chain management. These KPIs can help organizations monitor the effectiveness of their TQM initiatives and make data-driven decisions for further improvements [9].\n\nIn conclusion, Total Quality Management plays a critical role in enhancing supply chain performance by focusing on quality improvement, customer satisfaction, supplier management, employee involvement, process optimization, and performance measurement [10].", "references": ["Share this article\n\nAnyone you share the following link with will be able to read this content:\n\nGet shareable link\n\nSorry, a shareable link is not currently available for this article.\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nProvided by the Springer Nature SharedIt content-sharing initiative"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_8588c6bb-f610-43d0-8ea6-400be2e67e2a"}

", "references": ["Autism can be Cured\n\nYou hear about people beating autism, but how? An autism cure just sounds too good to be true. You\u2019ll have to not drag your feet on this. If you have a toddler with an autism diagnosis, it\u2019s best to go to work right away while the child is at this young and impressionable age of development. If you\u2019re not dealing with a toddler, the rational part of the brain doesn\u2019t stop developing until the age of 25, so don\u2019t give up. I\u2019ll explain more.\n\nCan autism be cured? Studies have concluded that as much as 9% can live healthy normal lives with no signs of autism after years of development. Some children can have dramatic almost immediate gains just by implementing a few changes in diet. So yes, some have been cured, but it\u2019s rare. This is exciting, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\n\nTop Ten Ways to an Autism Cure\n\nABA Therapy \u2013 ABA Therapy, again and again, has shown to improve autism effects. Some parents have even claimed their children have been cured through ABA. We disagree with some of their practices. More on this below. Test for Toxins\u2013 It\u2019s important to find out why you\u2019re detoxing. Get a hair analysis and find out specifically what some key toxins are in your body. Then deal with those things specifically. Gluten Free / Casein Free Diet \u2013 Many children with autism have severe gluten allergies. Gluten doesn\u2019t do anyone favors, but for some autistic children, it\u2019s a debilitating toxin. Same with casein. Implementing A Ketogenic Diet \u2013 Ketogenic diets were developed to treat epilepsy. Recently, they have shown to be just as useful in treating other neurological disorders like autism. Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT\u2019s) \u2013 If a ketogenic diet is difficult, MCT\u2019s might be your answer. The purpose of the keto diet is to raise blood levels of ketones to therapeutic levels. One of the best ways to get MCT\u2019s is through coconut oil. Consuming coconut oil can raise blood ketones to levels that can affect brain growth and development. CBD Oil \u2013 I know, sounds too good to be true. CBD Oil has helped some autistic kids tremendously. A recent study showed improvement in 80% of children. Repair The Gut \u2013 Scientists have been reporting links between bacteria in the gut and autistic behavior since 1960. L-glutamine is an amino acid that repairs the lining of the stomach and can be quite beneficial, and can be found as a supplement. Another product that we have seen results with is Restore Gut Health Mineral Supplement. Pre/Probiotics \u2013 In another recent study, implementing Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in higher levels of oxytocin and improved the brain\u2019s ability to form new connections that foster learning. Vitamins \u2013 Stay away from vitamin A and Zinc, there seems to be too much of it in the autistic child. But there\u2019s commonly a deficiency in Vitamin D, B6, Magnesium, and Calcium. Field Control Therapy \u2013 This is a pretty new therapy that we haven\u2019t had experience with. However, practitioners like Dr. Michael Cory state that Autism is curable with this method. Brain Inflammation \u2013 Encephalitis is a cause for many mental illnesses. Could your child\u2019s disorder be due to brain inflammation?\n\nA Closer Look at an Autism Cure\n\nAll these things have shown to improve the condition of autism. In some cases, the person came out with no signs of autism. So, let\u2019s take a closer look, especially at situations of being cured.\n\nABA Therapy\n\nI\u2019ve read amazing books from many parents that have autistic children. Some of them implementing ABA therapies themselves, some even doing ABA type therapies without even knowing they were practices of ABA.\n\nOne very common beginning therapy is sitting with the child teaching them basics and rewarding them for the correct response. Sometimes the reward is candy, other times it can be a joyful clapping response of approval.\n\nOur son immediately enjoyed everyone in the room getting excited when he could follow simple directions like pat your head, or wave your hand. It shocked him and he cried the first time, but he soon learned the fun of the experience. He started wanting to break out of a shell and interact with us. It was a very gradual thing, almost like watching a baby chick peck away at its eggshell prison. He\u2019d make efforts to come out, then take a break and withdraw, only to try again later.\n\nGetting used to their spiral of improving and failing is tedious. On the bright side, the spiraling does go upward if you stay consistent. It may be very very slow, but it\u2019s still progress. Remember the three P\u2019s: Persistence Pays Perpetually.\n\nHere\u2019s an article worth the read on A.B.A., and how a mother helped her son overcome autism through the therapies and her own persistence.\n\nABA therapy can also be very aggressive with these little guys when they don\u2019t listen, to the point of wailing and tears. Our son has always shown signs of empathy, so the moment they got aggressive I shut it down. I just knew mine wouldn\u2019t respond well, and in his situation specifically, he wasn\u2019t being bratty. He was just caught up in his world and didn\u2019t want to come out because of one of the therapists he didn\u2019t like. It would take hundreds of attaboys to bring him back from this one negative experience.\n\nIn the defense of ABA, understand that many autistic kids respond well to a militant type of dominant teaching. Some kids feel like they can run the roost if they can get the upper hand by being bratty. Bratty is bratty, autism or no autism, no excuses. Bratty can be confused with autism, sometimes they\u2019re closely knit. But every parent should know when their kid is being a brat.\n\nThere are books out saying that families had children that \u201crecovered\u201d from autism using ABA. I can tell you that the benefits are enormous, and many autistic behaviors can be eliminated, we\u2019ve seen it first hand.\n\nIf your insurance won\u2019t cover ABA it can be very expensive. If it\u2019s a financial situation for you, I recommend picking up one of the many books on ABA therapies that you can do on your own.\n\nTest for Toxins\n\nGet a hair analysis. Lot\u2019s of people don\u2019t like them, I love them. Every time we see a specific factor revealed by a hair analysis and then deal with that factor, the retest always shows the results we achieved on the repeated test. You need a starting point to know where any problems may be, and this is a very affordable way to do it.\n\nIf you can afford a more thorough expensive analysis, go for it. The better the test, the better the results.\n\nGluten and Casein\n\nDr. Mark Hyman discovered that one of his patients has a very level of gluten antibodies in his body. Like many autistic kids he also had leaky gut, and also had 28 food allergies. The list of toxins in him was pretty extensive.\n\nDr. Hyman got rid of gluten and casein, yeast, and killed off the bad bacteria in the child with specific antibiotics. Then replenish the child\u2019s body with probiotics and enzymes. He also added other things, like the appropriate vitamins, fats, and diet.\n\nIn 10 months the child \u201clost\u201d his diagnosis of autism. Of course, testing to find out what was wrong was key, but the child still had all the \u2018average\u2019 signs that autistic children have. Toxic, stomach issues, lack of certain nutrients, food allergies that cause certain behaviors.\n\nThere are other autistic children that have very noticeable improvements simply by cutting dairy products from their diet. Some of the results are astounding. Personally, our son does not do well with dairy. He some from time to time, but it\u2019s extremely limited.\n\nKetogenic Diet\n\nAlways consult with a doctor whom you trust before going on a diet.\n\nThis should be called Paleo and Keto diets because both have been found to be beneficial for children with autism because of ketones. Also, the Keto and Paleo diet have great benefits for good bacteria in the gut.\n\nThese diets have many benefits and should be looked into. However, I haven\u2019t seen any documentation on anyone being cured of autism because of sole use of these diets. On the other hand, diets always seem to play a part in getting better.\n\nMedium Chain Triglycerides\n\nIt\u2019s not as daunting as it looks. The purpose of a ketogenic diet is to get the body producing ketones and get those ketones up to therapeutic levels or levels that can start to heal the body. You can get the same result by consuming MCT\u2019s.\n\nWhen MCT\u2019s are ingested the liver turns them into ketones. But you have to add an adequate amount and replace most of the fats with MCTS. You also have to maintain a low carb intake.\n\nDr. Bruce Fife explains that using coconut oil can actually heal autism. In combination with a low card diet, \u2018Eating coconut oil can raise blood ketones to levels that can have a pronounced effect on brain growth and development\u2019. Coconut oil happens to be the richest source of MCT\u2019s.\n\nHe then continues, \u2018Thanks to coconut oil, a diagnosis of autism is no longer a life sentence. A cure is possible.\n\nCBD Oil\n\nIn a study published in the journal Neurology, autistic children were treated with high concentrations of CBD. CBD is a cannabinoid that is nontoxic.\n\nThe children tested found no relief of symptoms from any conventional drug therapies. Even so, 80% of the children conditions improved.\n\nStaggering results. On CBD, as far as we know, no child has been cured. The great results make this product definitely worth a try.\n\nRepair the Gut\n\nis vital. Most people try to keep up their keto or paleo diet as much as they can, but still slip up. The whole purpose of the diet is to heal the gut. Just get back up if you start to fall off the wagon.\n\nIn addition to the clean diet, also get L-Glutamine and digestive enzymes in the body as well. Enzymes just simply speed up the cells to do their jobs faster which do things like aid the metabolism and digest easier. L-Glutamine helps the gut in many ways in addition to repairing the stomach lining.\n\nBy taking a supplement in your times of diet weakness or even in addition to your paleo or keto diet can still get good results. Right now we\u2019re off the wagon, but we still give our son Restore Gut Health Mineral Supplement product.\n\nPrebiotics and Probiotics\n\nAn interesting study on how Lactobacillus reuterii in probiotics helped curb autistic behaviors in mice is very promising. We all knew healing the gut played a big role in autism, but this seems to verify it.\n\nDo not start these until you heal the gut, there would be little benefit. When you start to work on restoring the gut with prebiotics and probiotics do some research. This is honestly a post all it\u2019s own. Make sure your probiotic has the 2 most valuable groups of bacteria, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to only take the supplements you find, but you\u2019ll also want to eat probiotic foods like sauerkraut, miso, and kombucha, just to name a few.\n\nVitamins\n\nVitamins D, E, and Calcium seem to be deficiencies in many children with autism. Potassium and Choline can also be added to that list. The child can also have an overload of other vitamins, so make sure you get some sort of analysis so you have some sort of basis point.\n\nWe don\u2019t use solid vitamins. Because of a lack of enzymes, many people just can\u2019t digest the solid vitamins. Many times nurses nickname them \u201cbedpan bullets\u201d. We always use a chewable, or capsule so that the body can assimilate them correctly.\n\nNothing can take the place of the vitamins you get from eating live foods. Try to eat as many live foods as you can.\n\nField Control Therapy\n\nDr. Michael Cory and other trained doctors in this field state that autism is very curable using FCT\u2019s. Field Control Therapy finds the toxins in the body that the body is having trouble dealing with, then the practitioner prescribes diet, blood work and other things to rid the body of these anomalies.\n\nThis is a relatively new therapy, but it sounds promising. The fees for this type of service run upwards of $2,000, or you can pay per visit.\n\nBrain Inflammation\n\nThis might be one of the key factors to getting the brain to function properly. Encephalitis is a serious condition that is responsible for a lot of body dysfunction. This topic is a post all it\u2019s own, and is found on our site under Brain Inflammation and Mental Health.\n\nTime\n\nHere\u2019s Bonus #1. Can kids just be healed in time? Yes, there is a possibility of that happening. Here\u2019s an excellent study worth the read.\n\nInteraction\n\nBonus #2! Wow, this one is huge. Imagine being cut-off from the world, but even worse by something you have no control over. It may be difficult, but laughter is a huge healer and brings many of these kids out of their shell. This is trial and error on your behalf.\n\nIt took me a few trials to find out what made our son laugh. You\u2019ll find that whatever age your child is they laugh at the same things normal kids do. A fun game of chase (once they understand it), or even being tickled is a great way to get a child from out of their shell.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to be cured of autism from interaction, but everyone needs it! More so these little guys than anyone."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_193f5558-5b53-41cd-9fc5-62d091979c62"}

Cement, primarily composed of calcium silicates, is a common binding material used in making concrete, mortar, and other building materials [2]. In contrast, silica fume, a byproduct of the silicon and ferrosilicon industries, is a fine-grained, high-strength pozzolanic material that can be added to concrete mixtures to improve their performance and durability [3]. The choice between cement and silica fume depends on the specific requirements of the construction project[4]. Cement is a more versatile material, suitable for a wide range of applications, including residential and commercial buildings, roads, bridges, and other infrastructures [5]. It provides adequate compressive strength, durability, and workability for typical construction scenarios[6]. On the other hand, silica fume is primarily used as an admixture to enhance the properties of concrete [7]. It can increase the concrete's strength, durability, and resistance to chemical attack [8]. By reducing the permeability and porosity of the concrete, silica fume can help protect the embedded steel reinforcement from corrosion [9]. Additionally, it can improve the bond between the concrete and reinforcement, reducing the likelihood of cracking and failure [10]. However, it is important to note that silica fume is not a replacement for cement but rather an additive [11]. When used in combination with cement, it can significantly improve the performance of concrete in demanding applications such as high-rise buildings, bridges, marine structures, and wastewater treatment facilities [12]. In summary, the choice between cement and silica fume depends on the requirements of the construction project[13]. Cement is a versatile material suitable for general construction purposes, while silica fume can improve the performance and durability of concrete when used as an additive alongside cement [14].

The latter technique is called **reverse osmosis** and it is widely used in modern desalination plants[1].\n\n", "references": ["The world\u2019s freshwater supply is in crisis. 97.5% of Earth\u2019s water is undrinkable salt water. That leaves 2.5% of all water on Earth as freshwater, but 70% of that water is used for agriculture. That leaves less than 0.75% of Earth\u2019s water for human consumption, right? Wrong. For every 100 drops of rain, only 36 are \u2018blue water\u2019 \u2013 water that enters our freshwater sources. So really, just 0.27% of the world\u2019s water can be domestically used by humans. By 2050, food production is expected to increase by 60%, and accordingly, water demand is expected to rise by 55% between 2000 and 2050.\n\nCompounding the issue is climate change. Yes, the same change that is causing more intense rainstorms is actually causing a water shortage. The reality is that soil is becoming drier, which, along with warming temperatures, leads to drought. Hotter temperatures cause more water to evaporate from the soil. Thus, the soil has to absorb more water when it rains, leaving less running water for humans to use. This means that despite increased rainfall, floods have actually decreased in many regions because the soil sucks up the excess water, making it impossible to collect as freshwater. Due to this, less water runs off into the world\u2019s rivers. Furthermore, drying soil necessitates more water for agriculture, which exacerbates the already shrinking water supply.\n\nWater is supposed to be a renewable resource, but only if it is used responsibly. Unfortunately, water is not being used responsibly. Earth will never run out of water, but it may very well run out of usable water. Each year, 2.1 trillion gallons of water are lost in the United States due to leaking pipes. That\u2019s enough to supply 19 million households with water for a year, just in the U.S. But leaky pipes cannot account for the 117 trillion gallons of water used by the U.S. each year. Of that figure, 41% is used for thermoelectric power generation, 37% for irrigation, and just 3% for consumption. The real culprit of the world\u2019s shockingly high water use is irrigated agriculture, which is twice as productive as the rain-fed agriculture of centuries past. Irrigation allows for increased production and crop diversification to feed a growing population, but at the cost of the water required to irrigate fields, apply pesticides and fertilizers, and defrost crops. At the same time, water is being pumped at higher rates than it can be naturally replenished. For example, the largest underground water source in the U.S., the Ogallala Aquifer, is being pumped at rates thousands of times more quickly than it can be replenished by rainfall. The final main role of water is in thermoelectric power. Thermoelectric generators take a temperature difference between two metals and create electricity via the movement of electrons. Water is often used in this process to cool one end of the metal to create a temperature difference. Science Daily notes that if the renewable energy situation does not improve by 2040, there will not be enough available freshwater to meet the world\u2019s energy needs.\n\nIf humans can only drink 0.27% of the world\u2019s water, what if we could drink the other 99%? This is the promise made by saltwater desalination, which removes salt from seawater to make it drinkable. Sea levels are rising worldwide and cities are being attacked by waves. According to Live Science, Jakarta, Dhaka, Lagos, and Bangkok could be underwater by 2100. Closer to home, parts of Miami, Virginia Beach, New York City, and Boston \u2013 and all of New Orleans, could be underwater by the turn of the century. It makes sense to remove that excess water from the ocean that floods our cities and use it as drinking water.\n\nThe modern process of saltwater desalination utilizes reverse osmosis. When applied to desalination, the method sends water first through a filter to remove sediment and chlorine. Next, water passes through a semipermeable membrane to filter out dissolved solids, relying on the fact that water molecules are smaller than the pollutants in the water. Finally, the water goes through another filter to remove any remaining undrinkable substances. The main issue with reverse osmosis is that to maintain the incredibly high water pressure required to filter out pollutants, energy-intensive pumps and other equipment are required.\n\nSince its invention, energy usage has been the main prohibiting factor behind the wide adoption of desalination. But in 2021, two Purdue engineers developed a more energy-efficient system based on Professor David Warsinger\u2019s concept of batch reverse osmosis. The original system takes in a set amount of water at once, filters it, discharges it, and then loads the next quantity of water. This method lessened energy produced by pumps but increased processing time for desalinated water. Additionally, batch reverse osmosis wasn\u2019t much more energy-efficient either, because machines had to keep running between desalination batches. As such, the system was not widely adopted. But soon it may be. The newest rendition, \u201cdouble-acting batch reverse osmosis,\u201d improves the efficiency by using a piston system that allows the next batch of water to be loaded into a tank so it can go into the processing loop immediately after the previous batch is complete. Purdue\u2019s researchers found double-acting batch reverse osmosis to be the most energy-efficient method of desalination. It is actually 31% more efficient compared to standard reverse osmosis, which itself would only account for 4% of the country\u2019s energy usage if all of the U.S.\u2019s water was desalinated.\n\nAnother fundamental obstacle in the desalination process is that because reverse osmosis filters out salt and harmful chemicals, the residue \u2013 or brine \u2013 of the salt and chemicals must be disposed of somehow. Reverse osmosis outputs 58% brine and 42% usable water. Currently, brine is either dumped into the ocean, spread on land, or put in the ground. The issue is that brine is toxic to marine life. Aside from brine from thermal desalination (not reverse osmosis) being hotter than ocean water, brine often contains cleaning chemicals and heavy metals from the pipes it passes through. The amount of chemicals in brine is often very small, depending on the desalination method, but brine \u2013 which is almost all salt \u2013 removes oxygen from the water, suffocating certain species in coastal areas. Making seawater saltier also makes it more difficult to desalinate the water in the future. The main way processing plants combat this issue is by dumping brine into bodies of water with strong currents that can disperse the brine to the middle of the ocean, rather than allowing it to gather near the coast. However, this is only feasible when a desalination plant is located nearby an ocean with strong currents. This is not the case with the Arabian Gulf, for example, where many plants are located. Some plants have attempted to mitigate the brine problem by pumping the brine through multiple outlets, spreading it out in the water. Others use high-pressure pumps to push the brine further into the sea. These two methods have the least destructive impact of the many methods used for brine disposal, but they still cause minor issues with aquatic life near the outlet area. Still, that\u2019s a small price to pay to get clean water to those who need it, especially when the impacts of desalination can be mitigated to a satisfactory level.\n\nIf brine wasn\u2019t enough of a challenge, removing boron from desalinated water has proven difficult. Excess boron in water can cause plants to die, and over five grams of born intake per day can cause fatal conditions in humans. In seawater, boron concentration is 8-11 times as high as the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) recommended maximum boron levels. Most reverse osmosis membranes remove 73-90% of boron in water, while specialized filters can remove 95%. However, in warmer temperatures, where many plants are located, the boron concentration can be twice the WHO\u2019s maximum after reverse osmosis. The need for boron removal causes plants to implement more filters, specialized filters, and methods to increase pH (which makes it easier to remove boron). LG developed a specialized membrane that removes nearly 100% of boron, but these methods are often cost-prohibitive. Thus, desalination is not something that can be fully implemented overnight; it will involve years of infrastructure development and investment.\n\nThe most simple issue faced by proponents of desalination is that extracting water from the ocean directly kills marine life. When desalination plants pump seawater into their facilities \u2013 a process called entrainment \u2013 tiny organisms like plankton, fish eggs, and larvae are killed on the journey. However, according to marine biologist Daniel Cartamil, entrainment actually only accounts for 1-2% of plankton deaths in areas near desalination plants. Because desalination pumping doesn\u2019t affect most marine species (which are too big to fit through the pipes), its impact on aquatic ecosystems is generally minimal.\n\nDesalination is not a problem; it\u2019s a solution. As the planet warms and glaciers melt, more saltwater is being introduced every day while more freshwater is being depleted by droughts. The benefits of salt water desalination as a supplement to traditional water collection methods outweigh its detrimental effects."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_a68a91de-d5e1-4bf9-9ab2-e0ceec35dafa"}

For the sphere S^2, which is a 2-dimensional sphere, you want to compute its homotopy groups \u03c0_n(S^2) for various n. Here are some results for the homotopy groups of S^2 :\n\n1[4].

In other words, the 2-spheres in S^2 can be wrapped around it multiple times, and each distinct wrapping corresponds to an integer [8]. For n > 2, determining the homotopy groups involves using various algebraic and geometric techniques, such as the Hopf fibration, cellular homotopy groups, and homotopy groups of CW complexes [9].

The Basic Democracies system aimed to promote political stability, decentralize power, and improve governance at the grassroots level [1][2].\n\nThe reforms succeeded in certain areas, such as increasing political participation and fostering local governance. Under the Basic Democracies system, 80,000 elected representatives managed local affairs, which improved efficiency and accountability at the local level [1][3]. The system also succeeded in promoting rural development by allocating funds and resources to local areas, which in turn, contributed to building infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and schools [2][3]. \n\nHowever, the Basic Democracies system also faced several criticisms and shortcomings. Firstly, the reforms were seen as a means to consolidate Ayub Khan's power as he used the elected representatives to legitimize his rule [1][4]. Secondly, the system lacked adequate resources, training, and support for the elected representatives; consequently, many of them were unable to fulfill their roles effectively [2][4]. Thirdly, the system resulted in an overemphasis on local issues, which created a disconnect with national politics and hindered the necessity for a broader democratic process in Pakistan [3][5]. Finally, the system further entrenched the power of local elites and powerful landlords, who often manipulated elections and controlled the Basic Democracy institutions [2][4][5]. \n\nOverall, although Ayub Khan's Basic Democracy reforms resulted in some improvements in local governance and rural development, they ultimately failed to establish true democracy in Pakistan. The system was hindered by its links to authoritarian rule, resource deficiencies, and the continued influence of local elites [1][2][4].", "references": ["Mohammad Ayub Khan, (born May 14, 1907, Rehana, North-West Frontier Province, India [now Rehana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan]\u2014died April 19, 1974, near Islamabad, Pakistan), president of Pakistan from 1958 to 1969, whose rule marked a critical period in the modern development of his nation.\n\nAfter studying at Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh, India, and at the British Royal Military College at Sandhurst, Ayub Khan was commissioned an officer in the Indian army (1928). In World War II he was second-in-command of a regiment in Burma (Myanmar) and commanded a battalion in India. After the 1947 partition of British India, he was rapidly promoted in the army of the new Muslim state of Pakistan: from major general (1948) to commander in chief (1951). In addition, Ayub became minister of defense (1954) for a brief period.\n\nAfter several years of political turmoil in Pakistan, in 1958 President Iskander Mirza, with army support, abrogated the constitution and appointed Ayub as chief martial law administrator. Soon after, Ayub had himself declared president, and Mirza was exiled. Ayub reorganized the administration and acted to restore the economy through agrarian reforms and stimulation of industry. Foreign investment was also encouraged.\n\nAyub introduced the system of \u201cbasic democracies\u201d in 1960. It consisted of a network of local self-governing bodies to provide a link between the government and the people. Primary governing units were set up to conduct local affairs; their members were elected by constituencies of 800\u20131,000 adults. A national referendum among all those elected confirmed Ayub as president. He was reelected under this system in 1965, against a strong challenge from an opposition united behind Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the creator of Pakistan.\n\nWhen the United States began to rearm India after China\u2019s invasion of northern India in 1962, Ayub established close relations with China and received substantial military aid from it. In the meantime, Pakistan\u2019s dispute with India over Jammu and Kashmir worsened, culminating in the outbreak of war in 1965. After two weeks of fighting, both sides agreed to a UN-called cease-fire and came to a boundary settlement.\n\nThe failure to gain Kashmir, combined with student unrest over suffrage restrictions so intensified internal turmoil that at the end of 1968 Ayub announced he would not stand for reelection. Riots continued, and he resigned his office on March 26, 1969, to be succeeded by General Yahya Khan, commander in chief of the army."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_f61e6c3d-56cb-4359-a54e-e74a5cb5e8dd"}

Cement, primarily composed of calcium silicates, is a common binding material used in making concrete, mortar, and other building materials [2]. In contrast, silica fume, a byproduct of the silicon and ferrosilicon industries, is a fine-grained, high-strength pozzolanic material that can be added to concrete mixtures to improve their performance and durability [3]. The choice between cement and silica fume depends on the specific requirements of the construction project[4]. Cement is a more versatile material, suitable for a wide range of applications, including residential and commercial buildings, roads, bridges, and other infrastructures [5]. It provides adequate compressive strength, durability, and workability for typical construction scenarios[6]. On the other hand, silica fume is primarily used as an admixture to enhance the properties of concrete [7]. It can increase the concrete's strength, durability, and resistance to chemical attack [8]. By reducing the permeability and porosity of the concrete, silica fume can help protect the embedded steel reinforcement from corrosion [9]. Additionally, it can improve the bond between the concrete and reinforcement, reducing the likelihood of cracking and failure [10]. However, it is important to note that silica fume is not a replacement for cement but rather an additive [11]. When used in combination with cement, it can significantly improve the performance of concrete in demanding applications such as high-rise buildings, bridges, marine structures, and wastewater treatment facilities [12]. In summary, the choice between cement and silica fume depends on the requirements of the construction project[13]. Cement is a versatile material suitable for general construction purposes, while silica fume can improve the performance and durability of concrete when used as an additive alongside cement [14].

Influenced by the modernist art movement, it emphasizes function and prioritizes the use of new materials such as steel, glass, and reinforced concrete [4]. Some key examples of modern architecture include the Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier, the Farnsworth House by Mies van der Rohe, and the Case Study Houses by various architects [5]. Contemporary architecture, on the other hand, may encompass multiple architectural styles that are the result of continuous innovation and experimentation [6]. It often features a blend of aesthetics and materials, integrating sustainable and green building practices, with a focus on energy efficiency and environmental impact [7]. Contemporary buildings may also often use cutting-edge design technologies, such as parametric design and advanced engineering methods, to produce unique and innovative structures [8]. Examples of contemporary architecture include the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao by Frank Gehry, the Heydar Aliyev Center by Zaha Hadid, and the Shard by Renzo Piano [9]. In summary, modern architecture refers to a specific period and style in architectural history, characterized by clean lines, minimal design, and the use of new materials[10]. In contrast, contemporary architecture refers to current and varied building practices, reflecting ongoing developments and trends in design, materials, and technologies [11].", "references": ["[2] https://sciencing.com/differences-between-ecocentric-biocentric-18072.html\n\nDifferences Between Ecocentric & Biocentric | Sciencing equally important.

These differences may impact the comparative advantage of countries, trade costs, and serve as non-tariff barriers to trade[2]. First, differences in regulatory environments can affect the cost of production in various countries[3]. Regulations related to labor standards, environmental protection, and taxation can lead to a higher or lower cost of production for businesses in a given country[4]. This, in turn, can influence the comparative advantage of countries, determining which products they are more efficient at producing and the patterns of their international trade[5]. Second, differing regulations pertaining to quality and safety standards can also impact trade patterns[6]. Countries that impose strict quality and safety standards on their products may enjoy a competitive advantage in exports, as their products are perceived as being more reliable and of higher quality[7]. Conversely, countries with lower standards may face difficulties in exporting their products to more regulated markets, as their products may not meet the required criteria[8]. This can lead to a divergence in trade patterns, as countries with higher standards export more to quality-sensitive markets, while countries with lower standards may struggle to find export markets that accept their products[9]. Third, regulatory differences may serve as non-tariff barriers to trade, inhibiting the flow of goods and services between countries[10]. For instance, some countries may impose strict import regulations, such as quotas, licensing requirements, or customs procedures, making it more difficult for businesses in other countries to access their markets[11]. These barriers, in turn, can affect the volume and distribution of international trade, as well as the composition of exports and imports among countries[12]. In conclusion, differences in regulatory environments play a vital role in shaping the patterns of international trade[13]. They can impact the comparative advantage of countries, influence trade costs, and create non-tariff barriers to trade[14]. Understanding these differences, and their effects on trade patterns, is crucial for policymakers and businesses operating in an increasingly globalized economy[15].", "references": ["[4] https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/economic-incentives\n\nPolicy-makers have two broad types of instruments available for changing consumption and production habits in society.

It explains the relationship between individual human agency and social structures, suggesting that these two elements are not separate but rather intertwined in a continuous process of creating and recreating social systems [2]. According to Giddens, human behavior is influenced by social structures, such as norms, values, and institutions, while at the same time, individuals actively shape and change these structures through their actions [3]. In the context of migration, the theory of structuration can be used to explain the complex interplay between individual decisions to migrate and the broader social, economic, and political conditions that shape migration patterns and processes [4]. For example, individual migrants might be motivated by personal factors, such as economic opportunities, social networks, and the desire for a better life, while simultaneously being influenced by broader structural factors such as national and international migration policies, economic disparities between countries, and regional conflicts [5]. Structuration theory can also be used to understand the ways in which individual migrants and migrant communities participate in the construction and re-construction of social and cultural structures in both their home countries and their countries of destination [6]. Through their actions and interactions, migrants can contribute to the development of new social networks, the dissemination of information and ideas, and the establishment of new cultural norms and practices, thereby influencing the overall dynamics of migration [7]. In summary, the theory of structuration, as proposed by Anthony Giddens, offers a valuable framework for examining the complex and interdependent relationship between individual agency and social structures in the context of migration phenomena[8].

Mental models are complex and rooted in human nature. They affect how we see problems, and how we see people. Depending on how you use them, mental models can be incredibly constructive, or destructive.\n\nWhat are mental models?\n\nMental models are frameworks that give people a representation of how the world works. There are so many mental models that it would take a very long time to study them all in detail. Some are rooted in biological observations, others have been described in behavioural studies.\n\n\n\nTo put it simply, mental models are a set of beliefs and ideas that we consciously or unconsciously form based on our experiences. They guide our thoughts and behaviours and help us understand life. They\u2019re basically thinking tools\u2014shortcuts for reasoning.\n\n\n\nFor instance, knowing about network effects or about the law of diminishing returns helps you think about systems. Knowing about incentives or the availability heuristic helps you think about human relationships. Knowing about arbitrage and scarcity helps you think about markets and economic trends.\n\nI have always been fascinated by mental models. The same way scientists are looking for a theory of everything, I sometimes wonder if there is a universal theory of the mind. An all-encompassing, coherent framework that would fully explain and link together all aspects of our biology and psychology.\n\n\n\nWhile mental models are fundamental to understand how our mind works, they\u2019re far from perfect. They need to be used in context, and often in combination. As many mental models are reflective of the complexities of human nature, some are also good to know about in order to avoid falling prey to them.\n\nThink better with these 30 models\n\nHere is a list of fundamental mental models that you can start studying and observing in your daily life right now, in alphabetical order. I may add more in the future, but 30 is plenty to get started.\n\n\n\nAnchoring: a cognitive bias where an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information\u2014the \u201canchor\u201d\u2014when making decisions. Backward chaining: working backward from your goal. Classical conditioning: you\u2019ve probably heard about Pavlov\u2019s dog. Classical conditioning is a learning method in which a biologically potent stimulus\u2014such as food\u2014is paired with a previously neutral stimulus\u2014let\u2019s say a bell. The neutral stimulus comes to create a response (salivation) that is usually similar to the one created by the potent stimulus (in this case, food). Commitment and consistency bias: the desire to be and appear consistent with what we have already done. Common knowledge: knowledge that is known by everyone or nearly everyone, usually with reference to a particular community. Common knowledge doesn\u2019t necessarily mean truth, but most people will accept it as valid. Comparative advantage: the ability to carry out a particular economic activity\u2014such as making a specific product\u2014more efficiently than another activity. Diversification: the process of allocating your resources in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular risk. Economies of scale: the cost advantages that businesses obtain due to their scale of operation. The larger the scale, the smaller the cost per unit. Efficient-market hypothesis: a theory that states that prices fully reflect all available information. The hypothesis implies that is should be impossible to consistently beat the market, since market prices should only react to new information. Game theory: an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers. Hyperbolic discounting: a model which states that, given two similar rewards, people show a preference for one that arrives sooner rather than later. Illusion of control: the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events. Incentive: something that motivates or encourages someone to do something. Inversion principle: the process of looking at a problem backward. For example, instead of brainstorming forward ideas, imagine everything that could make your project go terribly wrong. Loss aversion: people\u2019s tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. We are basically more upset about losing $10 than we are happy about finding $10. Margin of safety: in a business, how much sales level can fall before a company reaches its break-even point. The sailboat metaphor: a dynamic model of human needs devised by Scott Barry Kaufman, such as physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualisation. Mechanical advantage: also called the law of the lever, it\u2019s a measure of how much your strength is amplified by using a tool or mechanical device. Mere-exposure effect: a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. Norm of reciprocity: the expectation that we repay in kind what another has done for us. Normal distribution: a theory which states that averages of samples of observations of random variables become normally distributed when the number of observations is sufficiently large. Operant conditioning: a learning process where the strength of a behaviour is modified by reinforcement or punishment. Redundancy: the duplication of critical components of a system with the intention of increasing its reliability. For example, a backup or a fail-safe. Scarcity: the limited availability of a commodity, which may be in demand in the market. Basically, when something is in short supply. Signalling theory: the science of determining whether people with conflicting interests should be expected to provide honest signals rather than cheating. Status quo bias: a preference for the current state of affairs, where the current baseline is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss. Supply and demand: an economic model which postulates that, in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good or service will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded will equal the quantity supplied, resulting in an equilibrium for price and quantity transacted. Surfing: the business principle of \u201criding the wave\u201d of a new technology, product, or trend. Survivorship bias: the logical error of concentrating on the people that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. Happens a lot in entrepreneurship. Tribalism: a way of thinking in which people are loyal to their social group above all else.\n\nHow to use mental models\n\nIf all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. A common misconception is that mental models should be dutifully practiced and applied in order to improve your mental performance. There are actually many mental models which you should work hard to avoid. For example, having an \u201cillusion of control\u201d can be particularly dangerous in some situations.\n\n\n\nIn order to grow as a human being, you need to be able to identify mental models, whether you are using them, or the person you are talking to is. Ideally, you need to make it a conscious choice to use them or not, instead of falling prey to the automatic thinking our brain loves so dearly.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo break a mental model is harder than splitting the atom.\u201d\n\nAlbert Einstein (but probably not)\n\nSo how can you challenge your mental models, identify them in others, and use them in a way that is actually effective and beneficial?\n\n\n\nHere are a few tips you can apply to master mental models, rather than being enslaved by them.\n\n\n\nBe aware of your thinking by asking yourself provoking questions\n\nGather information to challenge your thinking with actual facts\n\nInquire into other people\u2019s thinking and challenge their views\n\nResist jumping to conclusions and suspend your assumptions\n\nLook for recurring thought patterns and unlearn them\n\nA tool is only as good as its user. Only once you\u2019re aware of your mental models, you can use them effectively to achieve your goals.\n\nHow to build your own mental models\n\nIn a fast-moving environment, mental models can be extremely useful to help you think fast and make decisions. After all, they\u2019re great at giving you rules of thumb so you can, if done well, predict likely outcomes or behaviours.\n\n\n\nObserve people. One great way to develop your own mental models is to find inspiration in people. When you read a biography, ask yourself: why did they make this decision? What were they thinking? What mental model(s) did they use? It doesn\u2019t have to be famous entrepreneurs or creatives. We all have a friend or a colleague whose work we admire. When you see them make a specific choice in a complex situation, ask them how they came to that decision.\n\nOne great way to develop your own mental models is to find inspiration in people.

Ask a friend or a colleague to observe how you act and to help you identify behaviours that may not be obvious to you. This can be an incredibly uncomfortable but mind-expanding exercise.\n\nDon\u2019t limit yourself to constructive mental models. You will observe mental models which you\u2019d rather not reproduce. These are great to study as well, because it\u2019s easier to avoid a thought pattern when you know how to spot it in yourself and others. Constructive or destructive, name your mental models and write them down.\n\n5 great books about mental models\n\nIf you want to read more about mental models, here are some books to further explore the topic. Not only I found these books useful, but I\u2019ve seen them recommended over and over again on Hacker News and other places.\n\n"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_0d137269-9b3d-4529-8bb0-dcd64a7d566b"}

It explains the relationship between individual human agency and social structures, suggesting that these two elements are not separate but rather intertwined in a continuous process of creating and recreating social systems [2]. According to Giddens, human behavior is influenced by social structures, such as norms, values, and institutions, while at the same time, individuals actively shape and change these structures through their actions [3]. In the context of migration, the theory of structuration can be used to explain the complex interplay between individual decisions to migrate and the broader social, economic, and political conditions that shape migration patterns and processes [4]. For example, individual migrants might be motivated by personal factors, such as economic opportunities, social networks, and the desire for a better life, while simultaneously being influenced by broader structural factors such as national and international migration policies, economic disparities between countries, and regional conflicts [5]. Structuration theory can also be used to understand the ways in which individual migrants and migrant communities participate in the construction and re-construction of social and cultural structures in both their home countries and their countries of destination [6]. Through their actions and interactions, migrants can contribute to the development of new social networks, the dissemination of information and ideas, and the establishment of new cultural norms and practices, thereby influencing the overall dynamics of migration [7]. In summary, the theory of structuration, as proposed by Anthony Giddens, offers a valuable framework for examining the complex and interdependent relationship between individual agency and social structures in the context of migration phenomena[8]. By considering both the individual and the structural dimensions of migration, this theory can help to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the processes and implications of human movement across borders [9].", "references": ["[3] https://psyct.psychopen.eu/article/view/104/html\n\nBetween Bandura and Giddens: Structuration Theory in Social Psychological Research? | Oppong | Psychological Thought they are connected to one another in what Giddens has termed the \u2018duality of structure\u2019.

Most cases are idiopathic; however, a similar appearance may occur in Chagas disease. Authors differ as to whether to reserve the term achalasia for idiopathic cases or to include Chagas disease. Patients with Allgrove syndrome (triple A syndrome) also have achalasia which is very similar to the primary form of the disease.\n\nADVERTISEMENT: Supporters see fewer/no ads\n\nClinical presentation\n\nPatients typically present with:\n\ndysphagia for both solids and liquids: this is in contradistinction to dysphagia for solids only in cases of esophageal carcinoma 7\n\nchest pain/discomfort\n\neventual regurgitation\n\nSymptoms are initially intermittent.

This appears to be due to loss/destruction of neurons in the Auerbach/myenteric plexus. Early in the course of achalasia, the lower esophageal sphincter tone may be normal or changes may be subtle.\n\nPeristalsis in the distal smooth muscle segment of the esophagus is eventually lost due to a combination of damage to the Auerbach plexus and vagus nerve (possibly partly due to damage at the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve).\n\nClassification\n\nIt may be divided into three distinct types based on manometric patterns:\n\ntype I: (classic) with minimal contractility in the esophageal body\n\ntype II: with intermittent periods of pan-esophageal pressurisation\n\ntype III: (spastic) with premature or spastic distal esophageal contractions\n\nADVERTISEMENT: Supporters see fewer/no ads\n\nRadiographic features\n\nAchalasia characteristically involves a short segment (less than 3.5 cm in length) of the distal esophagus.\n\nPlain radiograph\n\nChest radiograph findings include:\n\nconvex opacity overlapping the right mediastinum.

It can also be useful to rule out possibility of any malignant mass in the region.\n\nCT\n\nPatients with uncomplicated achalasia demonstrate a dilated, thin-walled esophagus filled with fluid/food debris.\n\nOverall, CT has little role in directly assessing patients with achalasia, but is useful in assessing common complications.

It explains the relationship between individual human agency and social structures, suggesting that these two elements are not separate but rather intertwined in a continuous process of creating and recreating social systems [2]. According to Giddens, human behavior is influenced by social structures, such as norms, values, and institutions, while at the same time, individuals actively shape and change these structures through their actions [3]. In the context of migration, the theory of structuration can be used to explain the complex interplay between individual decisions to migrate and the broader social, economic, and political conditions that shape migration patterns and processes [4]. For example, individual migrants might be motivated by personal factors, such as economic opportunities, social networks, and the desire for a better life, while simultaneously being influenced by broader structural factors such as national and international migration policies, economic disparities between countries, and regional conflicts [5]. Structuration theory can also be used to understand the ways in which individual migrants and migrant communities participate in the construction and re-construction of social and cultural structures in both their home countries and their countries of destination [6]. Through their actions and interactions, migrants can contribute to the development of new social networks, the dissemination of information and ideas, and the establishment of new cultural norms and practices, thereby influencing the overall dynamics of migration [7]. In summary, the theory of structuration, as proposed by Anthony Giddens, offers a valuable framework for examining the complex and interdependent relationship between individual agency and social structures in the context of migration phenomena[8]. By considering both the individual and the structural dimensions of migration, this theory can help to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the processes and implications of human movement across borders [9].", "references": ["[2] https://epdf.pub/the-political-economy-of-regionalism-the-case-of-southern-africa-international-p.html\n\nThe Political Economy of Regionalism: The Case of Southern Africa (International Political Economy) - PDF Free Download rather than the opposition, between social structures and human agency.

SOR is important in terms of clearly defining roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities for various stakeholders to ensure coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness in addressing environmental challenges [8]. In conclusion, the relative importance of AOR or SOR depends on the context and objectives of a specific environmental project or organization[9]. Both AOR and SOR are crucial components of environmental management systems, and their importance may vary based on the scale of a project, the complexity of the issues being addressed, and the desired outcomes for the environment and society [10].", "references": ["[5] http://repository.library.cofc.edu/handle/123456789/3532\n\nPropagation of marine data through various spatial scales for the purpose of marine spatial planning Propagation of marine data through various spatial scales for the purpose of marine spatial planning Wolters_cofc_1000M_10260.pdf (6.081Mb) Wolters, Miranda Managing the marine environment can be difficult due to multiple changes through space and time and the many natural processes and activities that occur on the water surface, in the water column, and on the seafloor.

The tax rates vary depending on your age, residency status, and income level. The tax threshold for individuals ranges from R91,250 to R151,100 depending on age[1]. The tax rates for individuals range from 18% to 45% depending on income[1].\n\n", "references": ["What are your tax obligations in South Africa? We explain the South African tax system, local tax rates, filing tax returns, and VAT.\n\nYou must pay South African taxes if you work in South Africa or own a South African business. The amount you\u2019ll pay depends on certain factors, such as whether you are a resident or non-resident.\n\nExplore the various aspects of taxes in South Africa, including the following:\n\nThe tax system in South Africa\n\nSouth Africa uses a residence-based taxation system whereby residents are taxed on worldwide income and non-residents are taxed on South African-sourced income. With 23.9 million of its 59 million-strong population registered for personal income tax, most of the state\u2019s income comes from personal and corporate tax. Indirect taxes, though, such as Value-Added Tax do account for nearly a third of the government\u2019s coffers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal taxes in South Africa\n\nThe South African government levies a series of direct taxes on citizens and companies operating in South Africa. These include income and business taxes, capital gains, and inheritance taxes.\n\nIndirect taxes such as Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Fuel Duty also apply, as well as contributions towards social security in South Africa.\n\nMore information on who has to pay is available from the South African Revenue Service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaxes on goods and services in South Africa\n\nVAT in South Africa is levied on the consumption of goods and services. The VAT rate in South Africa is currently 15% on most goods and services and on imported goods, though there are some exceptions, for example some financial services.\n\nBusinesses are responsible for paying VAT to the government but they can pass on this charge to their customers or clients by adding VAT to the cost of invoiced goods and services.\n\nBusinesses must register for VAT in South Africa if their annual turnover exceeds R1 million within a 12-month period.\n\nCan you get a refund on VAT?\n\nTourists and diplomats visiting South Africa can claim a refund of the VAT they paid on goods purchased in the country. To qualify, you\u2019ll need to be a non-resident foreign passport holder or a South African passport holder who is now a permanent resident of another country. You can reclaim VAT when leaving the country by declaring the goods in question to a customs official.\n\nThe South African government\u2019s guide to VAT refunds for tourists offers further information on how to make a claim.\n\nWho has to pay tax in South Africa?\n\nYou must pay taxes in South Africa if you:\n\nAre a permanent or temporary resident of South Africa \u2013 if you have South African citizenship or a South African residence permit, you must pay taxes.\n\nHave lived in South Africa for more than 91 days in each of the last five tax years, and at least 915 days in total across those five years.\n\nAre a homeowner in South Africa. All homeowners (even non-residents) must register with the SARS in the event they are liable to pay capital gains tax on property.\n\nEarn more than R1.25 million in foreign employment income as a tax resident.\n\nThere are exemptions to these rules, for example, if you are elderly and/or make under a certain amount annually. However, if you qualify as a tax resident in South Africa, you must register as a taxpayer by visiting your local SARS branch to verify your identity, address, and bank details. You can finish the remainder of the process online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth African tax system for foreigners\n\nForeign residents pay the same income tax in South Africa as local citizens. For expats relocating to South Africa, there are a number of countries that have tax treaties with South Africa, including Australia, Japan, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which can help you to avoid double taxation in your home country.\n\nSince 1 March 2020, foreign employment income earned by a tax resident in excess of R1.25 million has been taxed in South Africa according to the tax tables for that year. This applies to residents who spend more than 183 days, of which at least 60 days are continuous, outside of South Africa in any 12-month period during that year of assessment.\n\nPensions\n\nThere is no tax on international pensions in South Africa. Local pensions, though, pay tax at various rates depending on whether it is a lump-sum or an annuity. South Africa is part of the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) system, a new global standard that aims to crack down on cross-border tax evasion.\n\nWithholding tax on interest or royalties\n\nThese are two taxes apply on interest or royalties paid to or for the benefit of a foreign person outside South Africa. The South African tax rate for this is 15%. The foreign person is liable for the tax, but the person making the payment must withhold it. There are certain exemptions, however.\n\nFiling US taxes from South Africa\n\nEvery US citizen and Green Card holder must file a tax return with the IRS even when living abroad.\n\nMany are unaware of these obligations, thinking that as an expat they do not need to pay or file tax returns in the US. You do! For more information and help filing your US tax returns from South Africa, see our guide to filing US taxes from abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncome tax rates in South Africa\n\nEarnings received from employment income, self-employed trade, rental income, investment income, and pension income are subject to income tax. Self-employed people pay income tax at the same levels as employees in South Africa.\n\nThese are South Africa\u2019s income tax bands for the 2023 tax year (1 March 2023 to 29 February 2024):\n\n\u200bTaxable income (R) \u200bRates of tax (R) Up to R237,100 18% of taxable income R237,101\u2013R370,500 R42,678 + 26% of taxable income above R237,100 R370,501\u2013R512,800 R77,362 + 31% of taxable income above R370,500 R512,801\u2013R673,000 R121,475 + 36% of taxable income above R512,800 R673,001\u2013R857,900 R179,147 + 39% of taxable income above R673,000 R857,901\u2013R1,817,000 R251,258 + 41% of taxable income above R857,900 R1,817,001 and above R644,489 + 45% of taxable income above R1,817,000\n\nTax calculators\n\nThere are a number of online income tax calculators where you can work out how much you\u2019ll need to pay, including those from:\n\nHow to file your income tax return in South Africa\n\nResidents who pay taxes in South Africa have to fill in an annual tax return form and submit it to SARS. The South African tax year runs from 1 March to 28/29 February. The tax season, when people submit their tax return forms, is from July to November depending on the filing method. Individuals and business taxpayers are required to make the necessary payments along with their South African tax returns.\n\nThis will be any amount owed that hasn\u2019t been paid through the Pay-as-You-Earn (PAYE) system, where tax contributions are automatically deducted from your wages. If you have to pay more in tax, payments can be made to SARS using any of the following methods:\n\nAt a bank\n\nVia a SARS eFiling\n\nVia an electronic funds transfer\n\nKeep in mind that not filing your tax return can result in a penalty ranging from R250 to R16,000 for each month that you don\u2019t comply. Furthermore, a 2021 law made tax negligence a potential criminal offense, carrying a prison sentence of up to two years.\n\nSelf-employed income tax in South Africa\n\nThough self-employed people are subject to income tax at the same levels as employees in South Africa, there are a few deductions you may be able to claim, for example, certain home office expenses. For information that\u2019s more specific to your work and financial situation, be sure to consult a tax specialist.\n\nTax on property and wealth in South Africa\n\nTransfer Duty\n\nAny property acquired in a sales transaction is subject to transfer duty. Since 1 March 2023, the South African tax rates for transfer duty are progressive at the following rates:\n\nProperty value Rates of tax R0\u2013R1,100,000 0% R1,100,001\u2013R1,512,500 3% on the value above R 1,100,000 R1,512,501\u2013R2,117,500 R12,375 + 6% on the value above R1,512,500 R2,117,501\u2013R2,722,500 R48,675 + 8% on the value above R2,117,500 R2,722,501\u2013R12,100,000 R97,075 + 11% on the value above R2,722,500 R12,100,000+ R1,268,000 + 13% on the value above R12,100,000\n\nTransfer duty is payable by the person acquiring the property and should be paid within six months from the date of acquisition to avoid incurring interest.\n\nTax on rental income\n\nIf you receive income from a rental property, you should declare this on your income tax. Though you will be taxed on this income, be sure to declare your expenses because certain ones \u2013 like agent fees, some insurance, and advertising \u2013 can be deducted. The SARS website has more information about tax on rental income.\n\nDonations tax\n\nDonations tax is a South African property tax payable on the value of any property disposed of as a donation. This is set at 20% of the property value up to R30 million, and 25% on properties valued at more. The tax is payable by the donor. It must be paid by the end of the month following the month in which the donation was made.\n\nThere are plenty of exemptions, including if the property recipient is a spouse, a segment of the government, or a public benefit organization. A donation is also exempt if the total yearly value of donations does not exceed R100,000 for individuals (R10,000 for businesses).\n\nCapital gains tax\n\nCapital gains tax is not a separate tax in South Africa but instead forms a part of income tax. Thus, any profit when selling an asset is subject to the same rates as South African income tax.\n\nInheritance tax in South Africa\n\nEstate duty is the name for inheritance tax in South Africa, which is a property tax payable on all estates with a net worth in excess of R3,500,000. The tax rate in South Africa for estate duty is 20% of properties worth up to R30 million and is 25% of properties worth more than this.\n\nThe South African government has agreements to avoid double death duties with Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Zimbabwe.\n\nRetirement property\n\nThose who retire in South Africa pay estate duty on property, wherever it is, in the event of their death.\n\nProperties located outside of South Africa are exempt if they were acquired prior to residency or were inherited from or donated by someone who is not a South African resident.\n\nCompany taxes and VAT rates in South Africa\n\nCorporate tax is payable on business income for all businesses and companies registered in South Africa. This includes:\n\nListed and unlisted public companies\n\nPrivate companies\n\nClose corporations\n\nCooperatives\n\nCollective investment schemes\n\nSmall businesses\n\nShare block companies\n\nCorporate bodies\n\nPublic benefit companies\n\nDormant companies\n\nCorporate tax in South Africa is charged at a flat rate of 28% for all companies (which will decrease to 27% for tax years ending on or after 31 March 2023). Small business corporations are taxed at lower progressive rates, starting at 7% on taxable income above R95,750, 21% for income between R365,000 and R550,000, and 28% for income exceeding R550,000.\n\nSkills Development Levy (SDL)\n\nSDL is a tax in South Africa payable by employers to promote learning and development of employees in South Africa. Employers become liable for SDL if their total annual salary bill is more than R500,000.\n\nSDL is charged to employers at a rate of 1% of the total salary bill. It is paid monthly by employers to SARS and the money is used for the skills development of employees.\n\nDividends tax\n\nA tax imposed on dividends payments, the dividends tax rate is 20%. This is a separate tax that is withheld from the dividend payment by the company making the payment, so is not something that needs to be accounted for nor paid by the payment recipient.\n\nSecurities transfer tax\n\nSecurities transfer tax is levied at 0.25% on every transfer of either a share or depository receipt in a company, or a member\u2019s interest in a close corporation.\n\nTurnover tax\n\nTurnover tax in South Africa is an alternate, simplified method of taxation for small businesses with an annual turnover of R1 million or less. It replaces income tax, capital gains, dividends tax, and VAT in South Africa, although there is an option to remain in the VAT system.\n\nThe turnover tax rates in South Africa are progressive, as follows:\n\nR0\u2013R335,000 \u2013 0%\n\n\u2013 0% R335,001\u2013R500,000 \u2013 1% of each R1 above R335,000\n\n\u2013 1% of each R1 above R335,000 R500,001\u2013R750,000 \u2013 R1,650 + 2% of the amount above R500,000\n\n\u2013 R1,650 + 2% of the amount above R500,000 R750,001 and above \u2013 R6,650 + 3% of the amount above R750,000\n\nImport and export taxes in South Africa\n\nCustoms duties\n\nCustoms duties are taxed on imported goods with the aim of raising revenue and protecting the local market. This tax is paid in addition to VAT and is usually calculated as a percentage of the value of goods.\n\nCertain food, drink, textile, and firearms products may be taxed according to volume.\n\nExcise duties and levies\n\nExcise duties and levies are imposed on high-volume daily consumable products (e.g., petroleum, alcohol, tobacco), as well as some non-essential and luxury items (e.g., electronic equipment, cosmetics).\n\nIn addition to raising revenue, this tax exists to discourage the consumption of products considered harmful to the environment. The rates of these taxes in South Africa vary from product to product.\n\nOther indirect taxes\n\nUnemployment Insurance Fund (UIF)\n\nUIF is an unemployment benefit fund payable to those who have been in employment for at least 24 hours per week if they become unemployed, sick, or take maternity leave.\n\nIt is a short-term, contribution-based benefit and is funded through contributions of 2% of the employee\u2019s salary (1% from the employer and 1% from the employee). It is the employer\u2019s responsibility to pay this out of employee salaries each month to SARS.\n\nFuel tax\n\nThe fuel tax is levied on petrol and diesel fuels. This tax can vary but, after the most recent fuel hikes, it is currently around 40% and included in the cost that consumers pay for fuel.\n\nTax advice in South Africa\n\nTaxes can be complicated, especially when you\u2019ve moved to a new country and need to get your head around the system.\n\nThe good news is that it\u2019s possible to get professional help. If you\u2019re filing your taxes in South Africa for the first time, it can be a smart move to employ an accountant. Likewise, you should consider taking independent financial advice on your business tax liabilities if you\u2019re setting up a company in South Africa.\n\nYou can get professional advice from the South African Institute of Tax Professionals on a range of tax-related issues.\n\nUseful resources"], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "ExpertQA", "id": "ExpertQA_4879f694-f8ae-454b-a19e-e563a0e5d97f"}

At the outset of the study period (1992), 18 of the 49 states with partisan legislatures had single-party trifectas and 31 states had divided governments. In 2013, only 13 states had divided governments, while single-party trifectas held sway in 36 states, the most in the 22 years studied.\nThe chart below shows the partisan composition of the Office of the Governor of Connecticut , the Connecticut State Senate and the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1992 to 2013.\nThe chart below depicts the partisanship of the Connecticut state government and the state's SQLI ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1-50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. Between the years 1992 and 2005, Connecticut ranked in the top-10 in the SQLI ranking, in the top-5 for twelve of those thirteen years, and ranked 1st in 1992 and 1993. Beginning 2005, Connecticut dropped out of the top-10 and began a trend downward until hitting its lowest spot during the period of the study (33rd in 2012). Connecticut had divided government for eighteen years before having a Democratic trifecta in 2011. The state\u2019s greatest decline in the SQLI ranking occurred between 2011 and 2012, when Connecticut dropped fourteen spots in the rankings.

In doubles, a team may accomplish the Grand Slam playing together or a player may achieve it with different partners. Winning all four major championships consecutively but not within the same calendar year is referred to as a \"non-calendar-year Grand Slam\", while winning the four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a \"Career Grand Slam\". [1] [2]\nThe Grand Slam tournaments , also referred to as majors , are the world's four most important annual professional tennis tournaments. They offer the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of field, and the longest matches for men (best of five sets, best of three for the women). The tournaments are overseen by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), [3] rather than the separate men and women's tour organizing bodies, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA), but both the ATP and WTA award ranking points based on players' performances in them. [4]\nThe four Grand Slam tournaments are the Australian Open in January, the French Open from late May to early June, Wimbledon in late June to early July, and the US Open in August\u2013September, with each played over two weeks. The Australian and the United States tournaments are played on hard courts , the French on clay , and Wimbledon on grass . Wimbledon is the oldest tournament, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891, and the Australian in 1905, but it was not until 1925 that all four were held as officially sanctioned majors. [5]\nGraphs are temporarily unavailable due to technical issues.\nWith the growing popularity of tennis, and with the hopes of unifying the sport's rules internationally, [5] the British and French tennis associations started discussions at their Davis Cup tie, and in October 1912 organized a meeting in Paris, joined by the Australasian , Austrian, Belgian , Spanish , and Swiss associations. [6] They subsequently formed the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), holding their first meeting in 1913, joined by the Danish, German , Dutch , Russian , South African, and Swedish organizations. [7] Voting rights were divided based on the perceived importance of the individual countries, with Great Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes. [8] Three tournaments were established, being designated as \"World Championships\":\nThe LTA was given the perpetual right to organize the World Grass Court Championships, to be held at Wimbledon, and France received permission to stage the World Hard Court Championships until 1916. [10] Anthony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of these World Championships in 1913. [11]\nThe United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) expressed disagreement over the power distribution within the ILTF and the designation of \"World Championship\" status to the British and French tournaments, and thus initially refused to join the Federation, choosing instead to be bystanders to their meetings. [12] [7] By the 1920s, with the World Covered Court Championships failing to attract top players and the growing success of American and Australian tennis, the ILTF worked to convince the USNLTA to join them, meeting their demand to drop the designation of \"World Championships\" from all three tournaments in March 1923, which led to the demise of both the World Covered Court Championships and the World Hard Court Championships. [9] [13] A new category of \"Official Championships\" was created for the national championships of Britain, France, Australia, and the US. [14] [15] By the 1930s, these four tournaments had become well defined as the most prestigious in the sport. [16]\nIn 1933, Jack Crawford won the Australian , French , and Wimbledon Championships, leaving him just needing to win the last major event of the year, the U.S. Championships , to become the reigning champion of all four major tournaments, [17] a feat described as a \"Grand Slam\" by sports columnist Alan Gould of The Reading Eagle , [18] and later that year by John Kieran of The New York Times . [19] [20] The term 'Grand Slam' originates from the card game contract bridge , where it is used for winning all possible tricks , and entered tennis via golf , where it was used for the first time to specifically describe a total of 4 wins, specifically Bobby Jones ' achievement of winning the four major golf tournaments three years earlier in 1930. [20] \"Grand Slam\" or \"Slam\" has since also become used to refer to the tournaments individually. [4]\nAt the time, only amateur players were allowed to participate in the Grand Slam and other ILTF-sanctioned tournaments. [21] Amateur standing, regulated by the ILTF alongside its associated national federations, forbade players from receiving prize money, earning pay by teaching tennis, being contracted by promoters and playing paid exhibition matches, though expense payments were allowed along with certain monies from sporting goods companies or other benefactors. [21] Amateurs who \"defected\" to become professional were banned from competing in amateur tournaments and dropped from their national associations. The first professional tour was established in 1926 by promoter C. C. Pyle with a troupe of American and French players, most notably Suzanne Lenglen , playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. [21] [22] Over the next decades many other head-to-head tours were run and professional tournaments established, [23] with three, the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships , French Pro Championship and Wembley Championships , standing out, and now considered to have been the professional majors and equivalents to the then-amateur Grand Slam tournaments. [24] By the 1950s, largely due to efforts of player/promoter Jack Kramer , this lucrative parallel circuit was luring in most of the star amateurs on the men's side, much to the ire of the ILTF and organizers of the Grand Slam tournaments. [25] It was an open secret that those that remained as amateurs were receiving under-the-table payments from their national associations to dissuade them from joining the pro ranks and secure their availability for the majors and Davis Cup, a practice derisively referred to as ' shamateurism ' that was seen as undermining the integrity of the sport. [26]\nTensions over this status quo, which had been building for decades, finally came to a head in 1967. In an experiment, the first tournament open to professional tennis players played on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the Wimbledon Pro , was staged by the All England Lawn Tennis Club in August, [27] offering a prize fund of US$45,000. [28] The tournament was deemed very successful, with packed crowds and the play seen as being of higher quality than the amateur-only Wimbledon final held two weeks earlier. [29] [30] This success in combination with large signings of top players to two new professional tours\u2014 World Championship Tennis and the National Tennis League \u2014convinced the LTA on the need for open tennis. [26] After a British proposal for this at the annual ILTF meeting was voted down, the LTA revolted, and in its own annual meeting in December it voted overwhelmingly to admit players of all statuses to the 1968 Wimbledon Championships and other future tournaments in Britain, \"come hell or high water\". [31] The eventual backing of the USNLTA that came after a February 1968 vote forced the ILTF to yield and allow each nation to determine its own legislation regarding amateur and professional players, which it voted for in a special meeting in March 1968. [32] This marked the start of the Open Era of tennis, [26] with its first tournament, the 1968 British Hard Court Championships , beginning three weeks later on 22 April in Bournemouth, England , [33] while the first open Grand Slam tournament, the 1968 French Open , was held in May. [26]\nEven after the advent of the Open Era, players including John McEnroe and Chris Evert have pointed out that skipping majors was not unusual before counting major titles became the norm, especially the Australian Open because of the travelling distance involved and the inconvenient dates close to Christmas and New Year. [34] [35] There were also the contracted professional players who had to skip some major events like the French Open in the 1970s because they were committed to the more profitable pro circuits. [35] [36] In one case, Australian players including Rod Laver , Ken Rosewall and Roy Emerson who had contracts with George MacCall 's National Tennis League were prevented from participating in the 1970 Australian Open because the financial guarantees were deemed insufficient. [37]\nAlthough it has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925, it was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon, the Australian and French Championships due to World War II, [38] the years from 1970 to 1985 when there was no Australian tournament in mixed doubles, [39] 1986 when there was no Australian Open, [39] and 2020 when Wimbledon was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

[k] [46] The inaugural edition took place in November 1905 on the grass courts of the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground in Melbourne , Australia. It was held as the Australasian Championships until 1927 and thereafter as the Australian Championships until the onset of the Open Era in 1969, [47] passing through various venues in Australia and New Zealand before settling at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club in Melbourne between 1972 and 1987. [48] Since 1988, it has been played on the hard courts of the Melbourne Park sports complex, which currently uses GreenSet as its court manufacturer. [49]\nManaged by Tennis Australia , formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), the tournament struggled until the mid-1980s to attract the top international players due to its distance from Europe and America and proximity to the Christmas and holiday season , [50] [51] but it has since grown to become one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere and the highest attended Grand Slam tournament, with more than 812,000 people attending the 2020 edition . [52]\nNicknamed the \"Happy Slam\" [53] and billed as \"the Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific\", [54] it has become known for its modernity and innovation, being the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play and install retractable roofs on its main courts, [55] the first to schedule night-time men's singles finals, [56] and the first to substitute electronic line calling for line judges , using an expanded version of the Hawk-Eye technology known as \"Hawk-Eye Live\". [57]\nThe tournament was designated a major championship by the International Lawn Tennis Federation in 1923. [58] Nowadays, its draws host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2021 tournament being A$ 71,500,000. [42]\nThe French Open, also known as Roland Garros, [59] [60] is the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late May and early June. [61] It was first held in 1891 on the sand courts of the Societ\u00e9 de Sport de \u00cele de Puteaux, in Puteaux , \u00cele-de-France , [62] [l] and repeatedly changed venues over the years before settling on the clay courts at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, where it has been contested since 1928. [64] [65] Both the venue and the tournament are named \"Roland Garros\" after the pioneering French aviator . [64]\nOrganized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration fran\u00e7aise de tennis (FFT), formerly known as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Lawn Tennis until 1976, [66] the French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament played on a red clay surface. [67] It is generally considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world. [68] [69]\nUntil 1925, the tournament was known as the Championnats de France (French Championships), and only French players and foreign members of French clubs were eligible to compete in it. [64] Before then, the World Hard Court Championships was considered the premier clay championship in France as it admitted international competitors, and it is therefore often seen as the true precursor to the modern French Open. [13] [70] From 1925 onward, the French Championships became open to all international amateurs and was rebranded as Internationaux de France (French Internationals), [64] and it was first held as an International Lawn Tennis Federation\u2013sanctioned major championship in the same year. [ citation needed ]\nToday, it has draws that host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2022 tournament being \u20ac 43,600,000. [43] The 2018 edition saw a record attendance of 480,575 spectators. [71]\nThe Wimbledon Championships, commonly known as Wimbledon, [72] is the third Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late June and early July. [73] It was first held on 1877 at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club , at the time located off Nursery Road in Wimbledon, London , England. [74] The tournament has always been contested at this club, which moved to its present site off Church Road in 1922 in order to increase its attendance capacity. [75]\nWimbledon is organized by a committee of management consisting of nineteen members, with twelve being club members and the remaining seven nominated by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA). [76] [77] As the world's oldest tennis event, [78] it is widely regarded as the most prestigious tennis tournament, [79] and it is known for its commitment to longstanding traditions and guidelines. [80] It is one of few tournaments and the only Grand Slam event that is still played on grass courts, [81] tennis's original surface, and where \"lawn tennis\" originated in the 1800s . [82] Players are required to wear all-white attire during matches, [83] and they are referred to as \"Gentlemen\" and \"Ladies\". [84] There is also a tradition where the players are asked to bow or curtsy towards the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court when either the Prince of Wales or the monarch are present. [85]\nThe tournament was given the title \"World Grass Court Championships\" by the International Lawn Tennis Federation between 1912 and 1923, [86] and was designated a major championship following the abolition of the three ILTF World Championships. [58] Since 1937, the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the United Kingdom, [87] with the finals shown live and in full on television in the country each year. [88] The BBC's broadcast of the 1967 edition was among the first colour television broadcasts in the UK. [89]\nToday, the event has draws that host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2021 tournament being \u00a3 35,016,000, [44] and 500,397 people attending the 2019 edition. [90] The tournament has some of the longest running sponsorships in sports history, having been associated with Slazenger since 1902, [91] and with the Robinsons fruit drink brand since 1935. [92]\nThe US Open is the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late August and early September. It was first held in August 1881 on grass courts at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island , United States. [93] The tournament constantly changed venues in its early years, [94] with each discipline continuing to be held separately at various venues until 1923, when the tournament settled at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens , New York City. [94] In 1978, it moved to the hardcourts of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows , Queens , where it has been contested ever since. [94] [95]\nOrganized by the United States Tennis Association (USTA), [96] previously known as the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) until 1920, [97] and as United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) until 1975, [98] it is the only Grand Slam tournament to have been played every year since its inception. [99] In 1997, Arthur Ashe Stadium , the largest tennis stadium in the world with a capacity of 23,771 spectators, [100] [101] was opened. [102] It is named after Arthur Ashe , the winner of the 1968 tournament\u2014the first in which professionals were allowed to compete. [103]\nOver the years, the tournament has pioneered changes and promoted ideas that other tournaments later implemented for themselves, including the introduction of a tiebreak system to decide the outcome of sets tied at 6\u20136 in 1970, [7] being the first Grand Slam tournament to award equal prize money to the men's and women's events in 1975, [7] the installation of floodlights in 1975 in order to allow matches to be played at night, [104] and the introduction of instant replay reviews of line calls using the Hawk-Eye computer system in 2006, the first Grand Slam tournament to do so. [105]\nThe ILTF officially designated it as a major tournament in 1923. [9] Today, the event has draws that host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2020 tournament being US$53,400,000, [106] and a US television viewership of 700,000. [107] [108] Since 2004, the tournament has been preceded by the US Open Series , composed of North American hardcourt professional tournaments that lead up to and culminate with the US Open itself. [109] The season is organized by the USTA as a way to focus more attention on American tennis tournaments by getting more of them on domestic television. [45]\nThe first player to win all four majors in a calendar year and thus complete the Grand Slam was Don Budge in 1938. [110] To date, five singles players (two men, three women), nine doubles players (four men, five women) and one junior (boy) have completed the Grand Slam. In wheelchair disciplines, two singles players (one quad, one woman) and twelve doubles players (four men, eight women) have achieved it. Margaret Court is the only player to complete the Grand Slam in two disciplines, singles and mixed doubles (twice), while wheelchair players Diede de Groot and Dylan Alcott have completed one in both the singles and doubles disciplines of their respective classes .

This revision by the Council and reportedly the ITF was approved by the representatives of the four Grand Slam tournaments at Wimbledon. [111] [112] However, in a 1983 letter from ITF General Secretary David Gray to tennis journalist Paul Fein, Gray claimed that it was never the intention of ITF to alter anything regarding the definition of the classic Grand Slam. [113]\nThere seems to be some confusion. The ITF's only initiative in this matter has been the organisation of the offer of a bonus of $1 million to any player who holds all four Grand Slam titles simultaneously ... Despite all that we have read on this matter, it has never been my Committee of Management's intention to alter the basis of the classic Grand Slam i.e., the capture of all four titles in a year.\nWriting in 1982, before the ITF had announced their bonus, Neil Amdur of the New York Times said, \"Now the sport spins nervously under the influence of big dollars and even bigger egos and tradition has almost gone the way of white balls and long flannels ... If the four major tournaments want to offer a $1 million incentive for any player in the future who can sweep their titles\u2014and such talks have been rumored\u2014that bonus would be a welcome addition. But changing what the Grand Slam is all about is like a baseball player believing that he ' hit for the cycle ' after slugging a single, double and triple in the first game of a doubleheader and a home run in his first-time at-bat in the second game.\" [112] Analyst Hal Bock of Associated Press criticized the traditionalists who point to the calendar to defend the sanctity of the accomplishment, describing them as \"self-appointed guardians, who use nothing more substantial than the flimsy pages of the calendar to brush away the achievement. The facts are these. The first five Grand Slams, Budge in 1938, Connolly in 1953, Laver in 1962/1969, and Court in 1970, happened to come in the traditional order, starting with the Australian in January and running through the U.S. tournament in September. Would they have been any less an achievement had the sequence started, say, at the French or at Wimbledon? Of course not.\" [114]\nWhen Martina Navratilova won the 1984 French Open and became the reigning champion of all four women's singles discipline, she was the first player to receive the bonus prize in recognition of her achievement. Some media outlets did, indeed, say that she had won a Grand Slam. [115] [116] Curry Kirkpatrick of Sports Illustrated wrote \"Whether the Slam was Grand or Bland or a commercial sham tainted with an asterisk the size of a tennis ball, Martina Navratilova finally did it.\" [117]\nWhen Steffi Graf completed the Grand Slam in 1988, George Vecsey wrote, \"Even the International Tennis Federation, which should have more respect for history, ruled in 1982 that winning any four straight majors constituted a Grand Slam\u2014and offered a $1 million bonus for it ... But many tennis people, and most writers, and probably most fans, too, did not accept the new rules, and the ITF has dropped the gimmick.\" [118]\nWhen Rafael Nadal was on the verge of completing a non-calendar-year Grand Slam at the 2011 Australian Open , one writer observed, \"Most traditionalists insist that the 'Grand Slam' should refer only to winning all four titles in a calendar year, although the constitution of the International Tennis Federation, the sports governing body, spells out that 'players who hold all four of these titles at the same time achieve the Grand Slam'.\" [119] As of 2012, however, the ambiguity was resolved, with the ITF's current constitution stating \"The Grand Slam titles are the championships of Australia, France, the United States of America and Wimbledon. Players who hold all four of these titles in one calendar year achieve the 'Grand Slam'.\" [1]\nCombining the Grand Slam and the non-calendar-year Grand Slam, only eight singles players on 11 occasions achieved the feat of being the reigning champion of all four majors, three men ( Don Budge , Rod Laver , Novak Djokovic ) [120] and five women ( Maureen Connolly , Margaret Court , Martina Navratilova , Steffi Graf , Serena Williams ). [121]\nThe following list is for those players who achieved a non-calendar-year Grand Slam by holding the four major titles at the same time but not in the calendar year. [1] Players who completed a Grand Slam within the same streak as a non-calendar-year Grand Slam are not included here.\nMartina Navratilova completed the feat in singles in 1984.\nSteffi Graf completed the feat in singles in 1994.\nSerena Williams completed the feat in singles in 2003, 2015.\nNovak Djokovic completed the feat in singles in 2016.\n|Key||AU||FR||WB||US|\n|Australian Open||French Open||Wimbledon||US Open|\n|#||Period||Player||Discipline||Major||Notes|\n|1||2||3||4||+|\n|1||1949\u201350||Louise Brough||Women's doubles||1949 FR||1949 WB||1949 US||1950 AU||N/A||[m]|\n|2||1967\u201368||Billie Jean King||Mixed doubles||1967 FR||1967 WB||1967 US||1968 AU||[n]|\n|3||1983\u201384||Martina Navratilova||Women's singles||1983 WB||1983 US||1983 AU||1984 FR||1984 WB||1984 US|\n|4||1986\u201387||Martina Navratilova (2)||Women's doubles||1986 WB||1986 US||1987 AU||1987 FR||1986 FR||[o]|\n|Pam Shriver||N/A|\n|5||1992\u201393||Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez||Women's doubles||1992 FR||1992 WB||1992 US||1993 AU||1993 FR||1993 WB|\n|Natasha Zvereva|\n|6||1993\u201394||Steffi Graf||Women's singles||1993 FR||1993 WB||1993 US||1994 AU||N/A|\n|7||1996\u201397||Natasha Zvereva (2)||Women's doubles||1996 US||1997 AU||1997 FR||1997 WB|\n|8||2002\u201303||Serena Williams||Women's singles||2002 FR||2002 WB||2002 US||2003 AU|\n|9||2009\u201310||St\u00e9phane Houdet||WC men's doubles||2009 FR||2009 WB||2009 US||2010 AU||2010 FR||[p]|\n|10||2009\u201310||Serena Williams (2)||Women's doubles||2009 WB||2009 US||2010 AU||2010 FR||N/A|\n|Venus Williams|\n|11||2012\u201313||Bob Bryan||Men's doubles||2012 US||2013 AU||2013 FR||2013 WB|\n|Mike Bryan|\n|12||2014\u201315||Shingo Kunieda||WC men's doubles||2014 WB||2014 US||2015 AU||2015 FR||[q]|\n|13||2014\u201315||Serena Williams (3)||Women's singles||2014 US||2015 AU||2015 FR||2015 WB|\n|14||2015\u201316||Novak Djokovic||Men's singles||2015 WB||2015 US||2016 AU||2016 FR|\n|15||2018\u201319||Diede de Groot||WC women's singles||2018 WB||2018 US||2019 AU||2019 FR|\n|16||2018\u201319||Dylan Alcott||WC quad singles||2018 US||2019 AO||2019 FR||2019 WB||[r]|\n|17||2021\u201322||Shingo Kunieda (2)||WC men's singles||2021 US||2022 AU||2022 FR||2022 WB|\n|18||2022\u201323||Niels Vink||WC quad doubles||2022 FR||2022 WB||2022 US||2023 AU|\n|Sam Schr\u00f6der|\nThe career achievement of winning all four major championships in one discipline is termed a \"Career Grand Slam\".

[2] Four men (Emerson, Laver, Djokovic, and Nadal) and five women (Court, Evert, Navratilova, Graf, Williams) have achieved the feat more than once over the course of their careers. [122] [123] [124]\nOnly six players have completed a Career Grand Slam in both singles and doubles: one male (Roy Emerson) and five females (Margaret Court, Doris Hart, Shirley Fry Irvin, Martina Navratilova, and Serena Williams). Court, Hart, and Navratilova are the only players to have completed a \" Boxed Set \", that is, winning all four major titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.

[125] Court's second Boxed Set, completed in 1969, spans the pre-Open and Open Eras, but she later completed a set entirely within the Open Era in 1973. [124] The Boxed Set has never been completed by a male player.\n- The event at which the Boxed Set was completed indicated in bold .\n|Boxed Sets||Player||Age||Australian Open||French Open||Wimbledon||US Open|\n|Singles||Doubles||Mixed||Singles||Doubles||Mixed||Singles||Doubles||Mixed||Singles||Doubles||Mixed|\n|2||Margaret Court||22||1960||1961||1963||1962||1964||1963||1963||1964||1963||1962||1963||1961|\n|26||1961||1962||1964||1964||1965||1964||1965||1969||1965||1965||1968||1962|\n|1||Doris Hart||29||1949||1950||1949||1950||1948||1951||1951||1947||1951||1954||1951||1951|\n|1||Martina Navratilova||46||1981||1980||2003||1982||1975||1974||1978||1976||1985||1983||1977||1985|\nThe term \"Golden Slam\" (initially \"Golden Grand Slam\") refers to the achievement of winning all four majors and the Olympic , Paralympic , or Youth Olympic gold medal in a calendar year. The phrase was coined in 1988, [127] [128] when Steffi Graf won that year's Australian Open , French Open , Wimbledon Championships , and US Open , and Olympic gold medal in singles. Graf is the only singles player to have won all five tournaments in a calendar year. [129] [130]\nDiede de Groot and Dylan Alcott also accomplished the feat, in wheelchair singles and wheelchair quad singles respectively. [131]\nSimilarly, the term \"non-calendar-year Golden Slam\" has been used since 2013, when Bob and Mike Bryan won the 2012 Olympics , 2012 US Open , 2013 Australian Open , 2013 French Open and 2013 Wimbledon Championships doubles titles consecutively. [132] [133] Their achievement was also dubbed the \"Golden Bryan Slam\". [134]\nA player who wins all four majors and the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal during their professional career (or the Youth Olympic gold medal during their junior career) is said to have achieved a \"Career Golden Slam\". [135] [133]\nSerena Williams is the only player to achieve the Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles with her singles gold at the 2012 London Olympics . [136] [137] Dylan Alcott , Diede de Groot , and Shingo Kunieda have since also accomplished it in the wheelchair disciplines.

The return of tennis to the Olympics in 1988 gave rise to the notion of a \"Super Slam\" as a combination of the Golden Slam and year-end championship title. [139] [140] [141] The year-end championships are currently the ATP Finals for the men's tour, WTA Finals for the women's tour, and the Wheelchair Tennis Masters for the wheelchair tennis tour .\nIn 2021, Diede de Groot became the first player to win all six titles in a calendar year, doing so in women's wheelchair singles. [142] Steffi Graf achieved a \"non-calendar-year Super Slam\" in 1988 by the aforementioned titles consecutively, [143] with her Golden Slam in 1988 following her victory at the 1987 Virginia Slims Championships , [144] the women's year-end championship at the time.\nA player who wins all four majors, the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal, and the year-end championship throughout their career is said to have achieved a \"Career Super Slam\". [139] [140]\nWheelchair players Diede de Groot and Shingo Kunieda are the only players in history to have completed a career Super Slam in both singles and doubles.\n|Singles||Doubles||Wheelchair singles||Wheelchair doubles|\n|Men||Women||Men||Women||Men||Women||Quad||Men||Women||Quad|\n|1||2||5||4||1||1||1||4||6||3|\nSeveral players have won three of the four majors in the same year, missing out on the Grand Slam by only one title, an achievement sometimes referred to as a \"Three-Quarter Slam\". [145] [146] [147] In five notable instances, singles players won the first three events of the year and went to the final major tournament with the opportunity to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam but lost. These were Jack Crawford in 1933, [148] Lew Hoad in 1956, [149] and Novak Djokovic in 2021 [150] in men's tennis, and Martina Navratilova in 1984 [151] and Serena Williams in 2015 [152] in women's tennis.\n|Singles||Doubles||Wheelchair singles||Wheelchair doubles||Junior singles||Junior doubles|\n|Men||Women||Men||Women||Mixed||Men||Women||Quad||Men||Women||Quad||Boys||Girls||Boys||Girls|\n|11||8||15||22||12||2||3||1||4||3||2||3||2||9||11|\nSince 1978, when the US Open changed its playing surface from clay to hard courts , [153] the four majors have been contested on three surfaces: clay, hard and grass . [154] A player who wins a major title on each of those three current surfaces in a calendar year is said to have achieved a \"Surface Slam\". [155] [156] From 1978 to 1987, the Australian Open and Wimbledon were played on grass, the French Open on clay and the US Open on hard, but since 1988 the Australian Open has also been played on hard courts. [157] In singles, the feat has been accomplished by two men: Rafael Nadal in 2010 and Novak Djokovic in 2021; [158] and three women: Martina Navratilova in 1984, Steffi Graf in 1988, 1993, 1995, 1996, and Serena Williams in 2002 and 2015.

[159] Wimbledon usually starts a few weeks after the end of the French Open, [160] meaning that the players who have deep runs in the French Open have little time to recover mentally and physically and to adapt to the different surface conditions found at Wimbledon. This has thus made winning both tournaments consecutively in the same year considered to be one of the challenging feats in a tennis season. [161] [162] Players who do so are said to have achieved a \"Channel Slam\", [160] in reference to the English Channel , the body of water separating France from the United Kingdom, the host countries of the French Open and Wimbledon. [160] In singles tennis, this feat has been achieved by 12 men and 10 women. In the Open Era , Rod Laver , Bj\u00f6rn Borg , Rafael Nadal , Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic are the only players to accomplish the feat in men's singles, and Margaret Court , Evonne Goolagong , Billie Jean King , Chris Evert , Martina Navratilova , Steffi Graf and Serena Williams in women's singles.

Many male top players \"went pro\" in order to win prize money legally, competing on a professional world tour comprising completely separate events . [164] From 1927 to 1967, the three tournaments later considered by some tennis journalists to have been the \"majors\" of the professional tour were:\nA player who won all three in a calendar year was considered retrospectively to have achieved a \"Professional Grand Slam\", or \"Pro Slam\". [165] [166] The feat was accomplished by Ken Rosewall in 1963 [167] and Rod Laver in 1967, [168] while Ellsworth Vines , Hans N\u00fcsslein and Don Budge have won the three major trophies during their careers. [169] The professional majors did not have a women's draw.

Governments should also focus on ensuring their cyber infrastructure is secure and trusted, and law enforcement should investigate and prosecute those responsible for cyber crimes.", "references": ["The government has been working tirelessly to prevent cybercrime, and they have made great strides in recent years. One of the most important things the government has done is to raise awareness about the issue. By educating the public about the risks of cybercrime and the steps they can take to protect themselves, the government has made it harder for cybercriminals to operate. The government has also put in place a number of legal and technical measures to prevent cybercrime. For example, the government has strengthened laws against cybercrime, and they have also established a national cybercrime task force . The government has also invested heavily in technology to help prevent cybercrime. For example, the government has developed software that can detect and block malicious activity, and they have also set up a network of secure computers that can be used to store sensitive information. The government\u2019s efforts to prevent cybercrime are having a positive impact. The number of cybercrimes reported to the police has fallen in recent years, and the government\u2019s investment in technology is starting to pay off. However, the government needs to do more to prevent cybercrime. Cybercriminals are always finding new ways to operate, and the government needs to stay one step ahead.\nAlmost half of UK businesses and a quarter of UK charities have been the victim of a cyber security breach or attack in the last year. Among medium-sized businesses (those with 50 or more employees), the figure is 58%, while among large businesses, the figure is 75%. It is becoming more common for cybercrime to occur. As a result, the UK government is acting quickly to address this issue. To send voltages of current through a body unseen and audible to a human, participants were asked to do so in the presence of a person whose own body was audible. They ended up doing so despite appearing distressed at times. Humans, on the other hand, like to trust and obey others.\nMaintain the most recent version of anti-virus software to protect your computer and your personal data from cybercrime. Having this protection in place ensures that your computer and your data are safe from cybercrime. If you are using anti-virus software, make sure that it is up to date in order to provide the best level of protection.\nIdentity theft and extortion attempts can occur as a result of cyber security attacks at an individual level, causing significant damage to their lives. Our personal information and data should be secure.\nThe government is teaching police about cybercrime issues . Training modules are being implemented to address mobile surveillance, tracing anonymous emails, and Phishing. In each state, there are already cyber cells and cyber forensic labs.\nYou can start by limiting your personal information online and by keeping social networking sites private, as well as by creating strong passwords, keeping online banking and payment systems private, and remaining cautious about using public websites. Cybercrime in India has evolved dramatically since the dawn of the Internet.\nCredit: SlideServe\nThere are many steps that the government takes to stop cyber crime, but some of the most important ones include: 1. Increasing awareness of cybercrime and its dangers. This can be done through public education campaigns, working with businesses and organizations to raise awareness, and increasing penalties for cybercriminals. 2. Working with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals. This includes training law enforcement in how to investigate cybercrime, providing resources for investigations, and working with international partners to track down and prosecute cybercriminals. 3. Strengthening cyber security. This includes working with businesses and organizations to improve their cyber security, investing in research and development of new cyber security technologies, and mandating minimum security standards for critical infrastructure. 4. Increasing international cooperation. This includes working with other countries to improve cyber security standards and sharing information on cybercrime investigations and prosecutions.\nThe Government has launched an online cybercrime reporting portal, www.cybercrime.gov.in, to allow victims to file cybercrime complaints relating to child pornography/child sexual abuse material, rape/gang rape images, and sexually explicit content. In order to address cybercrime issues in the country, a scheme has been launched by the Indian Government to establish an Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C). The CERT-In has begun publishing advisories and alerts on cyber threats. The requirement for periodic auditing of government websites and applications prior to hosting and at regular intervals. It is critical to conduct cyber security mock drills and exercises on a regular basis to assess the state of cyber security and to prepare organizations for future threats.\nCredit: governmenttechnologyinsider.com\nThe federal government is heavily involved in cyber security, with a number of agencies working on it. The National Security Agency (NSA), one of the most visible but least well-known, is a significant and important institution. They are in charge of intercepting foreign cyberattacks, as well as conducting cybercrime operations against adversaries.\nWhat is the role of government in cybersecurity? Is it government\u2019s job or private sector\u2019s responsibility? On this episode of Critical Path,RITICALSTART\u2019s SVP of Managed Security, Jordan Mauriello, and former Senator, assemblyman, and Homeland Security adviser Michael Balboni discuss this topic. Every time there is a bill that attempts to set goals for cyber resilience, cybersecurity, and cyber compliance , it is always defeated. If you went to the library of Congress to find a book on cybersecurity, you wouldn\u2019t find it, as the book isn\u2019t available in the United States. The federal government has two schools of thought about how to deal with cybersecurity. One of the concerns is that the private sector does not have the capability to manage its own affairs.\nFurthermore, it is the responsibility of the government. How do we find the right response? What amount of federal involvement would I need?\nCredit: SlideShare\nCybercrime is any crime that takes place online or through the use of electronic devices. This can include everything from identity theft and fraud to hacking and cyberstalking. While it\u2019s impossible to completely protect yourself from cybercrime, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk.\nThe best way to prevent cybercrime is to use strong security measures. This means using a strong password for all of your online accounts and never sharing it with anyone. You should also enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter a code from your phone in addition to your password.\nIt\u2019s also important to be careful about the information you share online. Don\u2019t post personal information like your address or birthdate, and be cautious about what you share on social media. If you receive an email from someone you don\u2019t know, don\u2019t click on any links or attachments. And if you think you may have been a victim of cybercrime, report it to the authorities.\nThere are several options for you to protect yourself against cyber attacks . One of the simplest ways to avoid online attacks is to create strong, unique passwords. You should always update your computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device whenever possible. A VPN encrypts your data and keeps you from being detected by others on the network. There are times when updating your devices is necessary to keep your information secure; however, updating your devices is not enough; it is critical in these situations. Select a dependable security software. The use of VPNs may help to protect your information, but they are not sufficient. Antivirus software, ad blockers, and firewalls are all required.\nThe eradication of cybercrime is a difficult task. You can reduce your chances of becoming a victim if you take the necessary precautions.\nHe is in charge of the Nation\u2019s strategic and unified efforts to strengthen the security, resilience, and workforce of the cyber ecosystem to protect critical services and the American way of life.\nWannaCry, a ransomware attack that hit 150 countries in 2017, affected over 300,000 machines, including those of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Governments are beginning to play an increasing role in coordinating security among public-private ecosystems. More states will analyze cyberthreat data in 2020 than previously did two years ago, rising from 43% to 60%. At every level, it is becoming increasingly common for organizations to collaborate and share information. ecosystems are primarily created on a global scale, whereas others are restricted to a particular location or region. This is a significant shift for government agencies, which used to restrict sensitive information to those who needed to know it. A greater level of collaboration in an ecosystem can result in an increase in the number and variety of systems, data, and tools that are used.\nGovernments can fill cybersecurity talent gaps by creating ecosystem-based solutions that create a thriving, common cyber talent market. Governments are encouraged to launch bug bounty programs, in which hackers are challenged to identify vulnerabilities in their networks. The Singapore Ministry of Defense launched a bug bounty program in which people were offered S$2,000 in cash for identifying 35 bugs. The security industry is moving toward models such as zero trust, which assumes that breaches exist and requires a third-party to verify that activity is authentic. Zero-trust models have grown in popularity as a result of the COVID-19 and rapid shift to remote work. Increase the range of cutting-edge tools and technologies available to you. When sharing threat information, make it easier.\nBy collaborating with other organizations, you can expand access to the right cyber skills. It is critical to instill a zero-trust mindset. Regardless of how executive decisions are made on new investments or operations, a seat at the table should be available to the cybersecurity community.\nThe National Cybersecurity Protection System, which includes the EINSTEIN cyber intrusion detection system, is one of the most popular tools; the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, which serves as the country\u2019s primary hub for organizing cyber responses; and a 2010 landmark agreement\nCyber attacks have had a significant impact on governments around the world. In some cases, such as the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, cyber attacks have disrupted government services and caused financial damage. In other cases, cyber attacks have been used to steal sensitive government information or to interfere with government operations. Cyber attacks can also damage government credibility and public trust.\nIn Europe, October was designated as Cyber Security Awareness Month. What is being confronted by the EU is the dilemma of its Digital Single Market: it is only going to work if it is secure. Our lawmaking process, on the other hand, is still largely based on the analogue world, and populism is threatening international cybersecurity cooperation. This directive aims to help Europe defend itself against cyber-attacks and improve its cybersecurity sector competitiveness, while also expanding on the NIS\u2019 focus on healthcare, energy, and transportation, as well as other areas of interest such as industrial controls, finance, and e-government. This important public policy objective for its citizens is being addressed in a slightly different way by the EU. The key, however, is that the EU must lead the transition to digitize core European industries while remaining focused on the \u201cEND\u201d goal, which requires the technical \u201cMEANS\u201d to remain with existing communities of experts. If properly executed, the early deliverables within Europe\u2019s core industries are immune to criticism.\nAgencies can defend themselves against hackers by using cybersecurity, which is an important issue for the government. Hackers have become more sophisticated as a result of the advancement of technology. A government agency must protect data at all stages of its life, from collecting it to transmitting it, to storing it, and finally destroying it. Disruption caused by a cyber-attack can lead to increased costs and altered business practices, among other things. reputational damage takes the largest toll.\nIn recent years, government cybersecurity has become a top priority for many countries around the world. This is due to the increasing number of cyber attacks that have been carried out against government agencies and businesses. Cybersecurity is a complex and ever-changing field, and it is constantly evolving to keep up with the latest threats. The government cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing, and it can be difficult to keep up with the latest trends and developments. However, it is important for government agencies to stay up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity threats and trends so that they can protect their networks and data.\nA cohesive national cybersecurity strategy is one that is designed to protect the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and information systems from cyber threats. The strategy should be comprehensive and address all aspects of cybersecurity, including prevention, detection, response, and recovery. It should also be flexible and adaptable to changing threats and technologies.\nCanada\u2019s average time spent online is 43.5 hours per month, making it the most technologically advanced country in the world. Despite the importance of being vigilant about cyber threats, Canada\u2019s cyber security policy cannot be motivated by fear or defensiveness. The 2018 budget includes more than $500 million in cyber security investments over the next five years. The use of digital technology introduces us to new threats. Cybercriminals and other malicious cyber threat actors, many of whom operate outside of our borders, exploit security gaps, low cyber security awareness, and technological advances to their advantage. In order for Canada to become a world leader in innovation and prosperity, we must have effective cyber security . The first Cyber Security Strategy in Canada allocated $431.5 million over ten years.\nThe document defines the key elements of a cyber-security environment around the world. The report lays out some of the ways in which the Government of Canada will respond to a wide range of new challenges and opportunities in cyberspace. The Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) has expanded its operations, providing regular notifications and communications to over 1300 organizations. The RCMP and other law enforcement agencies were able to increase their capacity to combat cybercrime as a result of the 2010 Strategy. The extent to which digital technology has evolved into what it is today would have been unthinkable a few years back. To better understand the cyber security implications of being a connected nation, a Cyber Review was launched. In the Cyber Review, we aimed to provide an overview of the state of cyber threats today.\nCanadian digital innovation and expertise in cyber security have enormous potential. As threats and opportunities change, so do we in response to our National Cyber Security Strategy. Every year, the stakes rise as more of our economy and essential services are made available online. Individual hackers, insider threats, criminal networks, nations, terrorist organizations, and state-sponsored actors are some of the malicious cyber actors . Canadians are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious cyber actors because more information is being made available online. Because of Canada\u2019s diverse population, the country\u2019s law enforcement agencies are increasingly challenged in protecting its citizens. As malicious cyber tools become more readily available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the country\u2019s economic health.\nCyber incidents can, in addition to profoundly destabilizing and jeopardizing e-commerce and government institutions, erode trust. Because more of Canada\u2019s critical infrastructure can be remotely controlled, cyber incidents pose a threat to national security. A cyber security gap can be exploited to disrupt services, gain access to other systems, or disrupt private data. In October 2016, millions of unsecured devices were used to overwhelm the servers of Dyn, an internet infrastructure company. Connected devices can be hacked on a massive scale, and cyber security is insufficiently secure. It is the responsibility of the federal government to maintain and improve cyber security. Small and medium businesses lack the necessary resources and knowledge to implement effective cyber security regimes.\nCyber security is having an impact on Canadian innovation and economic activity. There could be significant consequences if there is a disruption. The cyber security industry in Canada employs over 11,000 people and contributes to the country\u2019s GDP of more than $1.7 billion. According to industry analysts, the global cyber security market will grow by 66% by 2021. Government has a role to play in supporting advanced research, as well as assisting innovative companies in their growth. The demand for qualified professionals in the cyber security industry is increasing. As a result of a global shortage of qualified professionals, Canada has an opportunity to produce a highly skilled workforce.\nAs part of our strategy to support cyber research and development, the Government of Canada will work with partners to encourage investment. It will be an excellent resource for Canadian excellence in emerging technologies such as quantum computing and blockchain. The government of Canada has proposed a Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy to improve research and talent. The federal government has already invested in digital skills, such as coding education for young children. To address the cyber skills gap, governments, academia, and the private sector must collaborate. Individuals and organizations have vast control over the vast majority of Canada\u2019s digital systems. Because of this, many Canadians are unaware that they are vulnerable to cyber attacks.\nTo assist organizations and Canadians in recognizing the value of cyber security, the Government of Canada is leading the charge. The federal government must collaborate more closely with its partners in order to improve Canada\u2019s cyber security. A focal point for cyber security within the federal government is one example of how the government can demonstrate leadership in this field. In this way, we will serve as a model for the world by creating a national cyber strategy that is cohesive and coordinated. Augustine was invited to participate in the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC)\u2019s (CCIRC) annual Geek Week event. In addition to collaborating with cyber professionals and academics from Canada and other countries, he had a fantastic time. Augustine gained a lot of skills and professional connections while attending Geek Week, and he was able to return to work with them.\nThe Government of Canada will streamline its operations and work more closely with external partners and stakeholders as part of its reform process. In collaboration with provinces, territories, and the private sector, the federal government will lead the development of a national cyber incident response plan. We will advocate for a secure, free, and open internet, as well as increased international cooperation against cybercrime.\nThe execution of any cybersecurity strategy is made possible by the development of effective governance structures and processes. Executive structures should be clearly defined, lines of authority should be clear, and decisions should be made quickly. Any organization should prioritize the implementation of effective cybersecurity technologies . Companies can use technologies to protect their systems, detect and respond to attacks, and gain access to their systems. A successful cybersecurity strategy must take into account the operational aspects, which must be carried out in a highly efficient manner. A threat detection and prevention system should include processes such as identifying and detecting threats, conducting an incident response, and establishing best practices.\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Cyber Security Centre launched a national Cyber Aware campaign in October 2016. The campaign has four key messages:\n\u2013 Create strong passwords\n\u2013 Don\u2019t reuse passwords\n\u2013 Use two-factor authentication\n\u2013 Keep your software up to date\nThe campaign is aimed at individuals and small businesses, and aims to raise awareness of simple steps that can be taken to protect against cyber attacks.\nEvery year, the President of the United States and Congress call on citizens to learn about and protect themselves from cyber threats as part of the Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign. Keeping cybersecurity awareness up to date is an important step toward building mindfulness within an organization, allowing employees to be more aware of cyber-best practices. A cyber awareness program\u2019s primary goal is to educate people about the risk of cyber attacks and how to avoid a data breach. No security method can completely protect against these attacks, but it can reduce their frequency and empower end-user and professionals to better manage these risks. This is how a cyber awareness campaign can assist in making the internet a safe and secure environment for all.\n- September 24, 2022\nIf you have any information about a crime, you can contact Crime Stoppers anonymously and if your information leads to an arrest, you may be eligible for a cash reward.\u2026\n- October 10, 2022\nThe answer to this question is a bit complicated.

The incomes at the top, especially in the top 1 percent, have grown much faster than average,\u201d wrote Harvard\u2019s N. Gregory Mankiw , in a 2013 paper entitled \u201cDefending the One Percent.\u201d \u201cThese high earners have made significant economic contributions, but they have also reaped large gains. The question for public policy is what, if anything, to do about it. This development is one of the largest challenges facing the body politic.\u201d\nMankiw noted that the 1 percent\u2019s share of total income, excluding capital gains, rose from about 8 percent in 1973 to 17 percent in 2010, the latest figures available at the time. \u201cEven more striking is the share earned by the top 0.01 percent. . . .

Chicago Booth\u2019s Steve Kaplan says that income share for the 1 percent stagnated between 2000 and 2015.\nBut the disparities within the 1 percent have intrigued other economists. Who are the 0.01 percent? How well are they really doing? How are they making their money? And how, if at all, should policy makers respond?\nThe United States has 325 million people\u2014in 160 million households, as viewed by the Internal Revenue Service. That means 1.6 million households fall into the 1 percent category.\nThe threshold for membership in the 1 percent in 2014 was an annual household income of $386,000, excluding any capital gains, according to Chicago Booth\u2019s Eric Zwick . That\u2019s more than seven times the median household income that year of $54,000. The 0.1 percent, 160,000 families, in 2014 made at least $1.5 million a year. The top 0.01 percent, 16,000 families, had annual income of $7 million.\nThe top 1%\u2019s share of all US income\nUS households, including capital gains\nChart\nBar chart with 2 data series.\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories.\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying values. Data ranges from 2.463 to 22.028.\nEnd of interactive chart.\nIncome share is another way to assess how the strata of the 1 percent are doing.\nBetween 1995 and 2015, the income share (including capital gains) of the top 1 percent rose from roughly 15 percent to 22 percent, according to Piketty and Saez\u2019s data. The income share of the top 0.1 percent rose from 6 percent to 11 percent, and the income share of the top 0.01 percent rose from 2.5 percent to about 5 percent. In terms of percentage points, the top 1 percent\u2019s rose the most. In terms of the rate of increase, the 0.01 percent\u2019s did.\nAfter-tax income tells a similar story. For the top 1 percent, it nearly tripled between 1980 and 2014, according to research by Paris School of Economics\u2019 Thomas Piketty and UC Berkeley\u2019s Saez and Zucman. For the top 0.1 percent, it almost quadrupled in the same period. And posttax income for the 0.01 percent rose 423 percent. Posttax income for the entire US population rose by only 61 percent during this time, the study demonstrates.\nThe 0.01 percent also perform best in comparisons of wealth. Saez and Zucman, in an influential 2014 study, used income data from the IRS to \u201ccapitalize,\u201d or derive, wealth based on the expected aggregate rate of return from every asset class or source of income reported on tax returns. They say the share of total wealth of the top 1 percent has increased steadily, from below 25 percent in 1978 to 42 percent in 2012. The share of total wealth of the top 0.1 percent has roughly tripled, and the share of the 0.01 percent has more than quintupled. The top 0.01 percent of US households had at least $111 million in net worth in 2012, compared to $4 million for the 1 percent.\nThe top 1% by wealth\nResearchers\u2019 calculation of US household average (2010 dollars)\nChart\nLine chart with 3 lines.\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying values.

New York University\u2019s Wolff, using data from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, finds that between 1983 and 2013, the top 5 percent of households saw their wealth grow faster than the top 1 percent did. This would challenge the notion that wealth is increasingly concentrating at the top. He also argues that the rise in overall wealth inequality in the US from 2007 to 2010 is due less to very wealthy people\u2019s success than to the middle class\u2019s failures, chief of all taking on debt only to lose value in their homes.\nAnd Piketty and Saez\u2019s income-share data show that long-term growth has stagnated since 2000 for the 1 percent, 0.1 percent, and 0.01 percent, argues Chicago Booth\u2019s Kaplan. All three groups saw their income shares and inflation-adjusted incomes peak in 2007, and those shares have yet to recover to those pre\u2013Great Recession levels, he points out.\nUniversity of Chicago\u2019s Greg Kaplan says the main point of recent research he did with University of Minnesota\u2019s Fatih Guvenen is to highlight that there\u2019s variety in the group so many know as the 1 percent. \u201cWhen I hear people talk about top income inequality, I hear words and phrases such as \u2018top 1 percent,\u2019 \u2018top 0.1 percent,\u2019 \u2018top earners,\u2019 \u2018CEOs\u2019 . . . thrown around all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we need to keep in mind that these are very different people. They get their income from very different sources. They live in different parts of the country. . . . There is a huge amount of diversity, even within a group that we think is small but is actually very big, which is the top 1 percent.\u201d\nWhen discussing the super-rich, many bring up family dynasties such as the Waltons of Wal-Mart, or the Rockefellers and Koch brothers of energy fortunes. They may think, too, of highly paid corporate executives such as Apple CEO Tim Cook (who made $150 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg) , celebrities such as Diddy (who took home $130 million pretax in the year through June 2017, per Forbes) , and entrepreneurs such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (No. 5 on Forbes\u2019 2017 list of the world\u2019s billionaires).\nBut who is actually in the 0.01 percent? Researchers are developing a better understanding of how people in various rungs of the 1 percent make their money. And some research suggests business income plays a big part.\nSince the late 1990s, \u201cnearly all of the recent rise in top incomes has come in the form of business income,\u201d write Matthew Smith of the US Treasury Department, Danny Yagan of UC Berkeley, and Chicago Booth\u2019s Owen Zidar and Zwick, whose work focuses on the 1 percent and 0.1 percent. \u201cThe demand for top skill has outpaced its supply, with the returns to top skill increasingly taking the form of business income.\u201d\nThis income is broad-based among the 1 percent. \u201cWhat\u2019s covered on CNBC or in the Wall Street Journal or New York Times might be overemphasizing the drivers of wealth in Wall Street and Silicon Valley, and the economy is much bigger and more diverse than that,\u201d Zwick says. \u201cThere are a few Carnegies and Rockefellers, a Bill Gates and a Jeff Bezos here and there, but there are a lot more people earning between $300,000 and a few million dollars doing a lot of different things.\u201d\nSmith, Yagan, Zidar, and Zwick find that the 1 percent\u2019s income is being driven by owner-managers, mostly of small and medium-sized companies\u2014specifically S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. These are talented managers: the researchers find that profits of companies run by these 1 percent-ers are far higher than those of businesses owned by people in the top 5-\u201310 percent. In the researchers\u2019 sample, when these businesses\u2019 owners died prematurely, while still running their companies, profits plunged by more than half.\nThe average company in the top 1 percent of income has $7 million in sales and 57 employees, according to the research. \u201cIf that firm has, say, a 10 percent profit margin to split between two owners, it\u2019s enough to put someone in the top 1 percent category,\u201d says Zwick. The businesses earning the most profits in the bulk of the top 1 percent were physicians\u2019 and dentists\u2019 offices, professional and technical services, specialty trade contractors, and legal services.\nThe 20 richest Americans\nForbes 400 ranking by net worth, 2017\nChart\nBar chart with 20 bars.\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories.\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying values. Data ranges from 23 to 89.\nEnd of interactive chart.\nTo reach the top 0.1 percent of income, the average company has $30 million in sales and 150 employees. \u201cIf you\u2019re an auto dealer and you have five or six dealerships and you\u2019re doing $30 million in sales, you have a bunch of workers and you split $3 million in profits between one or two owners, that would put you in that top 0.1 percent group,\u201d says Zwick. In the top 0.1 percent, physicians\u2019 offices ranked only sixth in profits\u2014behind managements of private companies, financial and investment activities, auto dealers, professional and technical services, and oil and gas extraction.\nIt\u2019s harder to get at the source of income for the top 0.01 percent, but several studies indicate that finance could be an important sector for the group. Williams College\u2019s Jon Bakija , the US Treasury Department\u2019s Adam Cole , and Indiana University\u2019s Bradley T. Heim find that one-fifth of the primary taxpayers in the top 0.1 percent of income (including capital gains) work in finance. The latest data used in this study are from 2005, before the 2007\u201310 financial crisis altered the landscape. But between 2008 and 2012, \u201cfinance and insurance is by far the most highly represented industry among the highest earners,\u201d find Guvenen and Kaplan, who looked at the 0.1 percent. In the rest of the 1 percent, health care is the most represented sector.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s more detailed information about only the very richest of the 0.01 percent, and it seems to suggest that the richest members of the group may own large, successful businesses. Kaplan and Stanford\u2019s Joshua Rauh used Forbes \u2019 \u201crich list\u201d as a data set on the wealth of the richest Americans. Since 1982, Forbes has compiled an annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, using public information, private interviews, and valuations of comparable assets. As the rich list comprised 400 households, it represents the top 2.5 percent of the 0.01 percent\u2014the top 0.00025 percent of US households.\nBut this small group could control more than a quarter of the income in the 0.01 percent. According to Saez and Zucman\u2019s calculations, in 2012 the top 0.01 percent had an average wealth of $371 million, which would imply a collective total of $6 trillion. That same year, the estimated combined net worth of the individuals on the Forbes 400 list was $1.7 trillion.\nAmong the group who made the rich list, for almost one in four, finance\u2014especially hedge funds and private equity\u2014was the source of wealth, while 15 percent came from technology-based companies. Food and beverage companies accounted for 10 percent.\nAnd these sectors were on the upswing. \u201cThe \u2018finance and investments\u2019 category grew in representation by around 16 percentage points, technology (both computer and medical) by 11 percentage points, and retail/restaurant by 10 percentage points,\u201d Kaplan and Rauh write.\nOn the 2016 rich list, two-thirds were self-made and one-third had inherited at least part of their fortune. More than 10 percent were immigrants to the US.\nPiketty and Saez have theorized that investments grow faster than the economy, giving entrenched dynasties insuperable advantages. But Kaplan and Rauh argue that the super-rich are predominantly creating rather than inheriting wealth. Kaplan also says that wealth in this group has been fueled by a marriage of in-demand skills, globalization, and technology\u2014the combination of which are allowing businesses to scale up as never before.\nSkills, say many economists, are critical to the modern economy. As the US economy grows, jobs are going unfilled as companies scramble to find skilled people to hire. There\u2019s a flip side to this: as certain skills have become scarce, this has raised the amount companies are willing to pay people who have them. The situation has similarly raised the amount of profits skilled company owners can make, and technology and globalization are further magnifying the value of in-demand skills.\nHigh-income US workers\u2019 top industries\nShare of workers in each industry\nGuvenen et al., 2014\nIf this is true, the 0.01 percent are most likely benefiting from what economists call \u201cskill-biased technological change\u201d\u2014the increasing return on certain skills in an economy driven by technology and globalization. Under this well-established theory, a shortage of in-demand skills raises the value of those skills in rapidly expanding markets, and new technology helps some workers\u2019 productivity grow much more than others\u2019, exacerbating inequality.\nIn the Information Age, the change has been particularly pronounced. \u201cIn business, you can use technology to do things you couldn\u2019t do 30 years ago,\u201d says Steve Kaplan . \u201cYou can scale your business using technology, and you can use people in India and China and all over the world\u2014you couldn\u2019t do that as effectively 30 years ago.\u201d This, he argues, has been spectacularly positive for poorer people in developing countries. In 1990, the World Bank estimated that roughly 35 percent of the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, less than 11 percent of the world\u2019s population is so impoverished.\nAnd it has been good for wealthy residents of developed countries. For them, the result has taken the form of the \u201csuperstar\u201d or \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d phenomenon, first identified in a landmark 1981 paper by the late Sherwin Rosen , who taught at the University of Chicago. \u201cIn certain kinds of economic activity there is concentration of output among a few individuals,\u201d wrote Rosen. \u201cRelatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and dominate the activities in which they engage.\u201d\nTechnology, from the internet to media such as ESPN and Bloomberg terminals, has given elite athletes, entertainers, entrepreneurs, and financiers the ability to profit on a much larger, global scale, making the fruits of their labor more valuable than what previous superstars, such as, say, Pel\u00e9 or Babe Ruth, brought in. Ruth\u2019s peak salary of $80,000 would be worth about $1.1 million in 2016 dollars, around one-thirtieth of the $33 million the highest-paid Major League Baseball player, pitcher Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers, made in salary alone in 2016.\nThe world\u2019s hundred highest-paid athletes, led by Cristiano Ronaldo and LeBron James, stars of soccer and basketball, respectively, \u201cbanked a cumulative $3.11 billion\u201d over the past 12 months, Forbes calculated this past June. Among entertainers, rapper/entrepreneur Diddy and singer Beyonc\u00e9 each raked in more than $100 million over the same period, Forbes estimated.\nAnd hedge-fund managers make multiples more than top athletes and entertainers. James Simons of Renaissance Technologies and Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates each made more than $1 billion in 2016, even though, as Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha reported, the top-25 hedge-fund earners took in the least as a group since 2005, largely because of the industry\u2019s overall poor investment performance.\n\u201cTechnology allows a hedge fund to be able to manage $20 billion and invest it,\u201d says Steve Kaplan . \u201cI don\u2019t think people had the systems and information to do that 20 to 30 years ago. Now they have the systems and the information to do that. That technological change is here and is not going away. If anything, it\u2019s getting stronger.\u201d\nThe question of what, if anything, should be done in response to the spectacular rise of the 0.01 percent is a thorny one, as Mankiw acknowledged. \u201cAt the outset, it is worth noting that addressing the issue of rising inequality necessarily involves not just economics but a healthy dose of political philosophy,\u201d he wrote.\nWhen policy makers want to address the concentration of income and wealth, the first place some have looked is the top marginal tax rate, which slid in the US and other developed countries after the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. The US and UK had tax rates as high as 80 percent, wrote Saez and Piketty in the Guardian in 2013. \u201cThe job of economists should be to make a top rate tax level of 80 percent at least \u2018thinkable\u2019 again.\u201d But on this, Steve Kaplan disagrees. Raising the top marginal rate could send people and their money scurrying for tax havens, he says, pointing to France as an example.\nRaising the top tax rates in the US could also send people to take advantage of more favorable tax rules within the code itself. And closing perceived loopholes can be controversial. For example, some people working in finance benefit from the code\u2019s treatment of carried interest, where income flowing to the general partner of an investment fund is typically treated as capital gains and therefore taxed at a lower rate.\nComposition of the 0.01%\u2019s wealth\nResearchers\u2019 calculation, 2012\nBar chart with 5 data series.\nThe chart has 1 X axis displaying categories.\nThe chart has 1 Y axis displaying values. Data ranges from 1.791763132 to 100.\nEnd of interactive chart.\nSaez and Zucman, 2016\n\u201cThis tax preference is viewed as an unfair, market-distorting loophole by some but consistent with the tax treatment of other entrepreneurial income by others,\u201d writes the Tax Policy Center.\nThen there\u2019s the issue of whether raising the top marginal rate could discourage business activity. The marginal rate is intended to tax individuals on their earnings, and it rises with income. But a lot of business income is being taxed at that marginal rate rather than a corporate rate. Because the top US marginal personal tax rate was lower than the corporate rate for some time, business owners had an incentive to change their form of corporate organization from the traditional C corporation, which has profits taxed at the higher, corporate rate, to a partnership, limited liability corporation, or S corporation, taxed at the lower, individual rate. By 2011, these pass-through entities accounted for most of the business income earned in the US. (For more, see \u201cThe $100 billion tax dodge,\u201d Summer 2016.)\nPolicy makers should design an income-tax system that takes into account the nature of the income, and design a system that harmonizes taxes to discourage people from shopping the code for the best tax rates, Zwick suggests\u2014recognizing this is a tall order.\nAnd despite his research interest, Greg Kaplan says we should be careful about populist reactions that lead us to focus too much on the super-rich: \u201cWe are better off concentrating on how to improve the lives of those in the bottom 50 percent.\u201d In this group, many workers are in desperate need of a skills upgrade. As these workers fall behind, many economists say, policy makers need to focus on better preparing them for the workforce, perhaps by investing in education, working more closely with local companies to determine what skills their workers need, and removing barriers such as onerous regulations preventing people from entering certain professions. (For more, see \u201cHow to create middle-class jobs,\u201d Summer 2017.)\nIn short, there\u2019s a split among economists. Some argue that income needs to be distributed more equitably, while others say governments should focus less on taking actions that could inhibit top earners and more on addressing the reasons others aren\u2019t as successful. Do we slow the 0.01 percent or lift the 99.99 percent, which could be a heavier and more complex assignment?

But in the streaming era, viewers are frequently caught off guard by run times that vary considerably from one episode to another.\nFreed from the need to fill a half-hour (actually, 21 minutes with commercials) or an hourlong (e.g., 44 minutes plus ads) time slot in linear TV, producers are allowing their shows to breathe \u2014 and let the story dictate how long or short an episode can be.\nNetflix\u2019s new Shonda Rhimes drama \u201c Inventing Anna ,\u201d for instance, is an hour long \u2026 sometimes. Other episodes clock in at as many as 75 minutes, while the finale lasts a nearly movie-length 82 minutes. Disney Plus\u2019 \u201cThe Book of Boba Fett,\u201d meanwhile, varies anywhere between 39-minute episodes to a 61-minute finale.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so strange that for my whole life, we were completely focused on\u201d episode length, says Gareth Neame, executive producer of \u201c The Gilded Age \u201d on HBO, who performed similar duties on \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d \u201cThe story had to fill a certain space. If you were really passionate, sometimes you could get another 30, 40 seconds, 60 seconds out of the broadcast because you just needed that extra space. And then suddenly, it\u2019s fallen away as a major decider.\u201d\nSo far in Season 1, \u201cThe Gilded Age\u201d has fluctuated between more broadcast-style 46-minute episodes with longer 56-minute episodes (and an opening that clocked in at 80 minutes). Indeed, many hour-long episodes on streamers are just that \u2014 a full hour, which actually means a hefty 15 minutes more than your average drama on an ad-supported broadcast or cable channel.\n\u201c Hacks \u201d executive producers Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky note that when they worked on cable shows such as \u201cBroad City,\u201d they had to cut split seconds of their characters breathing to get their comedies to conform to the 21-minute limit.\nNow, the added length \u201callows us to have room for stories that might have otherwise been really short,\u201d Downs says. \u201cWe actually get to explore certain things that we otherwise might not.\u201d\nWhen \u201cEvil\u201d moved from CBS to Paramount Plus, executive producers Robert and Michelle King suddenly had more freedom to edit the show to the length they needed. \u201cWe have been able to take advantage of the running-time looseness,\u201d Michelle King says. Adds Robert King: \u201cWe went back to Episode 1 and filled in some details of stuff that we cut because of length.\u201d\nMega-sized episodes have long become the norm in reality TV, where two- and even three-hour episodes of shows like \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cThe Voice\u201d are not uncommon. For show obsessives, that\u2019s perhaps a good thing. But unscripted shows are obviously easier to digest and don\u2019t require quite the same level of concentration as a lengthy scripted episode. And with so many programs to power through in the Peak TV era, having to sit through longer-than-usual episodes can be exhausting.\nEven veteran showrunners note that there\u2019s a different rhythm to TV versus the big screen \u2014 despite the moviemakers who insist they\u2019re creating \u201clong-form films\u201d \u2014 and some of that comes from knowing your time limits.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one part of me that quite likes the discipline,\u201d Neame says. \u201cYou know that every scene that stayed in the cut is something that really earns its place. Even if you\u2019re bingeing something all the way through, we have a sense of how long an episode should last. If you start to go half an hour over, that feels a bit confusing. There\u2019s a natural length to an episode that we\u2019ve all been trained to watch.\u201d\nThe irony in longer episodic lengths is that, as a whole, TV seasons are much shorter in the premium cable and streaming age. Beyond network procedurals and comedies, the days of 22-episode and 24-episode seasons are mostly a thing of the past, replaced by the 10, eight or even six-episode orders. That means that actually, even with these jumbo episodes, there\u2019s a lot less of your average series to consume than there was a decade ago.\nCoincidentally, the conversation about whether TV episodes are too long comes as there\u2019s a general consensus in film that movies have pushed the limits with their run times. Those three-hour films? Why, that\u2019s akin to a three- or four-episode limited TV series!\nUltimately, TV has entered an age of choice \u2014 not just for viewers, but for producers too.

If your doctor suspects that you have C. difficile infection, a sample of your stool would be tested for the bacterium.\nTreatment for antibiotic-associated diarrhea depends on the severity of your signs and symptoms.\nIf you have mild diarrhea, your symptoms likely will clear up within a few days after your antibiotic treatment ends. In some cases, your doctor may advise you to stop your antibiotic therapy until your diarrhea subsides.\nIf you develop C. difficile infection, your doctor will likely stop whatever antibiotic you're currently taking, and might prescribe antibiotics specifically targeted to kill the C. difficile bacteria causing your diarrhea. You may also be asked to stop taking stomach-acid-suppressing drugs. For people with this type of infection, diarrhea symptoms may return and require repeated treatment.\nTo cope with diarrhea:\nDrink enough fluids. To counter a mild loss of fluids from diarrhea, drink more water or drinks that contain electrolytes. For a more severe loss, drink fluids that contain water, sugar and salt \u2014 such as oral rehydration solution. Try broth or fruit juice that isn't high in sugar. Avoid beverages that are high in sugar or contain alcohol or caffeine, such as coffee, tea and colas, which can worsen your symptoms.\nFor infants and children with diarrhea, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to replenish fluids and electrolytes.\n- Avoid certain foods. It's a good idea to avoid dairy as well as fatty and spicy foods while you have diarrhea. You can usually get back to a normal diet soon after your symptoms resolve.\n- Ask about anti-diarrheal medications. In some cases of mild antibiotic-associated diarrhea, your doctor may recommend anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide (Imodium A-D). But check with your doctor before taking anti-diarrheal medications because they can interfere with your body's ability to eliminate toxins and lead to serious complications.

Ultimately, whether or not voting should be mandatory is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides.", "references": ["If you don\u2019t want to vote, it\u2019s your right not to vote.\nJune 17, 2022 \u2022 Commentary\nShare\nA handful of countries, most notably Australia, impose mandatory voting, with citizens facing fines and punishments if they don\u2019t appear at the polls. And every few years, somebody proposes bringing this practice to the United States as a good\u2010government reform that would allegedly improve the health of our democracy.\nLuckily, Americans remain unimpressed by the idea. A report advocating mandatory voting by the Brookings Institution and Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Ash Center acknowledged as much. When polled, they found only 26% of Americans favored the idea, with 64% opposed.\nThe claimed benefits of mandatory voting are highly dubious. The evidence shows it would have little effect on election outcomes because non\u2010voters tend to break down about the same as for voters in their partisan preferences.\nThe main effect visible in Australia is the frequency of the so\u2010called \u201cdonkey ballot,\u201d where voters randomly pick a candidate or party without giving it any thought, often simply choosing the option listed first on the ballot. Others return a blank ballot, clearly going through the motions only to avoid punishment.\nBeyond the lack of clear, practical benefit, mandatory voting sits uneasily with American principles. The First Amendment protects not only freedom of speech but also freedom from compelled speech. And even if a coerced voter shows up and casts a spoiled ballot, participating in an election is a speech act. It implies affirmation of the legitimacy and desirability of the electoral system and our current constitutional order. That might be a correct opinion, in my view, but it is not one Americans should be forced to affirm.\nThe United States has a long history of principled abstention from voting, including groups such as the Quakers and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, who are motivated by a thoroughgoing religious faith in strict pacifism. Others, such as anarchists ranging from libertarians to socialists, reject the moral legitimacy of all governments and do not want to lend their endorsement to the state.\nFaced with the need to accommodate such groups or at least some of them, compulsory voting faces two bad options. Either any person can invoke a religious or philosophical exemption, rendering the whole exercise pointless, or must put the government in the untenable position of judging which reasons are good enough.\nEven if the First Amendment argument doesn\u2019t convince you, the last thing our bloated criminal justice system needs is yet another reason to impose fines and enforcement actions on Americans, especially when such burdens will fall disproportionately on minorities and the poor. Every law must be enforced, and the police in our country already have more than enough laws to enforce.\nEven if the political will could be mustered to pass a compulsory voting law, the courts are unlikely to permit it under longstanding First Amendment principles. During World War II, the court faced another attempt at coercing civic affirmation: mandatory recital of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. Again, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses refused, believing this was an act of flag\u2010worship akin to idolatry.\nJustice Robert H. Jackson, writing for a 6\u20133 court, offered one of the most stirring articulations of America\u2019s radical free speech jurisprudence: \u201cIf there is any fixed star in our constitutional firmament, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion or other matters of opinion.\u201d\nShowing up to vote may well be a laudable act, one to be encouraged, an admirable exercise of civic duty and participation in our system of government. But as a matter of opinion, it is not the government\u2019s role to impose that view as compulsory orthodoxy.

These properties make the Group 4 elements suitable for a variety of applications, such as in the manufacture of lightweight, durable products, and in protective plating.", "references": ["We have daily contact with many transition metals. Iron occurs everywhere\u2014from the rings in your spiral notebook and the cutlery in your kitchen to automobiles, ships, buildings, and in the hemoglobin in your blood. Titanium is useful in the manufacture of lightweight, durable products such as bicycle frames, artificial hips, and jewelry. Chromium is useful as a protective plating on plumbing fixtures and automotive detailing.\nTransition metals are defined as those elements that have (or readily form) partially filled d orbitals. As shown in Figure\n, the d -block elements in groups 3\u201311 are transition elements. The f -block elements , also called inner transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the d orbital is partially occupied before the f orbitals. The d orbitals fill with the copper family (group 11); for this reason, the next family (group 12) are technically not transition elements. However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical properties and are commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemists do treat the group 12 elements as transition metals.\nThe d -block elements are divided into the first transition series (the elements Sc through Cu), the second transition series (the elements Y through Ag), and the third transition series (the element La and the elements Hf through Au). Actinium, Ac, is the first member of the fourth transition series , which also includes Rf through Rg.\nThe f -block elements are the elements Ce through Lu, which constitute the lanthanide series (or lanthanoid series ), and the elements Th through Lr, which constitute the actinide series (or actinoid series ). Because lanthanum behaves very much like the lanthanide elements, it is considered a lanthanide element, even though its electron configuration makes it the first member of the third transition series. Similarly, the behavior of actinium means it is part of the actinide series, although its electron configuration makes it the first member of the fourth transition series\nThe elements of the second and third rows of the Periodic Table show gradual changes in properties across the table from left to right as expected. Electrons in the outer shells of the atoms of these elements have little shielding effects resulting in an increase in effective nuclear charge due to the addition of protons in the nucleus. Consequently, the effects on atomic properties are: smaller atomic radius, increased first ionization energy, enhanced electronegativity and more nonmetallic character. This trend continues until one reaches calcium (Z=20). There is an abrupt break at this point. The next ten elements called the first transition series are remarkably similar in their physical and chemical properties. This general similarity in properties has been explained in terms of their relatively small difference in effective nuclear charge over the series. This occurs because each additional electron enters the penultimate 3d shell providing an effective shield between the nucleus and the outer 4s shell.\nWhat is a Transition Metal?\nThus, the transition elements can be defined as those in which the d electron shells are being filled and so we generally ignore Sc and Zn where Sc(III) is d 0 and Zn(II) is d 10 .\nIt is useful, at the beginning, to identify the physical and chemical properties of transition elements which differ from main group elements (s-block). Properties of transition elements include:\n- have large charge/radius ratio;\n- are hard and have high densities;\n- have high melting and boiling points;\n- form compounds which are often paramagnetic;\n- show variable oxidation states;\n- form coloured ions and compounds;\n- form compounds with profound catalytic activity;\n- form stable complexes.\n|Element||Group|| density |\n/g cm -3\n| m. p. |\n/ \u00b0C\n| b.p. |\n/ \u00b0C\n| radius |\n/ pm\n| free atom |\nconfiguration\n| ionization energy |\n/ kJ mol -1\n|Uses|\n|Sc||3||2.99||1541||2831||164||[Ar] 3d 1 4s 2||631|\n|Ti||4||4.50||1660||3287||147||[Ar]3d 2 4s 2||658||-engines/aircraft industry-density is 60% of iron|\n|V||5||5.96||1890||3380||135||[Ar]3d 3 4s 2||650||-stainless steel, 19% Cr, 9% Ni the rest Fe|\n|Cr||6||7.20||1857||2670||129||[Ar]3d 5 4s 1||653||-alloys eg with C steel, the most significant use|\n|Mn||7||7.20||1244||1962||137||[Ar]3d 5 4s 2||717||-alloys eg with Cu|\n|Fe||8||7.86||1535||2750||126||[Ar]3d 6 4s 2||759||-alloys eg with C steel, the most significant use|\n|Co||9||8.90||1495||2870||125||[Ar]3d 7 4s 2||758||-alloys eg with Cr and W for hardened drill bits|\n|Ni||10||8.90||1455||2730||125||[Ar]3d 8 4s 2||737||-alloys Fe/Ni armor plating, resists corrosion|\n|Cu||11||8.92||1083||2567||128||[Ar]3d 10 4s 1||746||-high electrical conductivity (2nd to Ag), wiring|\n|Zn||12||7.14||420||907||137||[Ar]3d 10 4s 2||906|\nThe transition elements are much denser than the s-block elements and show a gradual increase in density from scandium to copper. This trend in density can be explained by the small and irregular decrease in metallic radii coupled with the relative increase in atomic mass.\nThe melting points and the molar enthalpies of fusion of the transition metals are both high in comparison to main group elements. This arises from strong metallic bonding in transition metals which occurs due to delocalization of electrons facilitated by the availability of both d and s electrons.\nIn moving across the series of metals from scandium to zinc a small change in the values of the first and second ionization energies is observed. This is due to the build-up of electrons in the immediately underlying d-sub-shells that efficiently shields the 4s electrons from the nucleus and minimizing the increase in effective nuclear charge\nfrom element to element. The increases in third and fourth ionization energy values are more rapid. However, the trends in these values show the usual discontinuity half way along the series. The reason is that the five d electrons are all unpaired, in singly occupied orbitals. When the sixth and subsequent electrons enter, the electrons have to share the already occupied orbitals resulting in inter-electron repulsions, which would require less energy to remove an electron. Hence, the third ionization energy curve for the last five elements is identical in shape to the curve for the first five elements, but displaced upwards by 580 kJ mol -1 .\nTransition metals can form compounds with a wide range of oxidation states. Some of the observed oxidation states of the elements of the first transition series are shown in Figure\n. As we move from left to right across the first transition series, we see that the number of common oxidation states increases at first to a maximum towards the middle of the table, then decreases. The values in the table are typical values; there are other known values, and it is possible to synthesize new additions. For example, in 2014, researchers were successful in synthesizing a new oxidation state of iridium (9+).\nFor the elements scandium through manganese (the first half of the first transition series), the highest oxidation state corresponds to the loss of all of the electrons in both the s and d orbitals of their valence shells. The titanium(IV) ion, for example, is formed when the titanium atom loses its two 3 d and two 4 s electrons. These highest oxidation states are the most stable forms of scandium, titanium, and vanadium. However, it is not possible to continue to remove all of the valence electrons from metals as we continue through the series. Iron is known to form oxidation states from 2+ to 6+, with iron(II) and iron(III) being the most common. Most of the elements of the first transition series form ions with a charge of 2+ or 3+ that are stable in water, although those of the early members of the series can be readily oxidized by air.\nThe elements of the second and third transition series generally are more stable in higher oxidation states than are the elements of the first series. In general, the atomic radius increases down a group, which leads to the ions of the second and third series being larger than are those in the first series. Removing electrons from orbitals that are located farther from the nucleus is easier than removing electrons close to the nucleus. For example, molybdenum and tungsten, members of group 6, are limited mostly to an oxidation state of 6+ in aqueous solution. Chromium, the lightest member of the group, forms stable Cr 3+ ions in water and, in the absence of air, less stable Cr 2+ ions. The sulfide with the highest oxidation state for chromium is Cr 2 S 3 , which contains the Cr 3+ ion. Molybdenum and tungsten form sulfides in which the metals exhibit oxidation states of 4+ and 6+.\nThe electronic configuration of the atoms of the first row transition elements are basically the same. It can be seen in the Table above that there is a gradual filling of the 3d orbitals across the series starting from scandium. This filling is, however, not regular, since at chromium and copper the population of 3d orbitals increase by the acquisition of an electron from the 4s shell. This illustrates an important generalization about orbital energies of the first row transition series. At chromium, both the 3d and 4s orbitals are occupied, but neither is completely filled in preference to the other. This suggests that the energies of the 3d and 4s orbitals are relatively close for atoms in this row.\nIn the case of copper, the 3d level is full, but only one electron occupies the 4s orbital. This suggests that in copper the 3d orbital energy is lower than the 4s orbital. Thus the 3d orbital energy has passed from higher to lower as we move across the period from potassium to zinc. However, the whole question of preference of an atom to adopt a particular electronic configuration is not determined by orbital energy alone. In chromium it can be shown that the 4s orbital energy is still below the 3d which suggests a configuration [Ar] 3d 4 4s 2 . However due to the effect of electronic repulsion between the outer electrons the actual configuration becomes [Ar]3d 5 4s 1 where all the electrons in the outer orbitals are unpaired. It should be remembered that the factors that determine electronic configuration in this period are indeed delicately balanced.\n|Redox Couple||E \u00b0/ V|\n|Mn 2 + (aq.)/Mn(s)||-1.18|\n|H + (aq.)/ H 2 (g)||0.00|\nThis shows that elemental Mn is a stronger reductant than molecular hydrogen and hence should be able to displace hydrogen gas from 1 mol dm -3 hydrochloric acid.\nValence Electrons in Transition Metals\nReview how to write electron configurations, covered in the chapter on electronic structure and periodic properties of elements. Recall that for the transition and inner transition metals, it is necessary to remove the s electrons before the d or f electrons. Then, for each ion, give the electron configuration:\n- cerium(III)\n- lead(II)\n- Ti 2+\n- Am 3+\n- Pd 2+\nFor the examples that are transition metals, determine to which series they belong.\nSolution\nFor ions, the s -valence electrons are lost prior to the d or f electrons.\n- Ce 3+ [Xe]4 f 1 ; Ce 3+ is an inner transition element in the lanthanide series.\n- Pb 2+ [Xe]6 s 2 5 d 10 4 f 14 ; the electrons are lost from the p orbital. This is a main group element.\n- titanium(II) [Ar]3 d 2 ; first transition series\n- americium(III) [Rn]5 f 6 ; actinide\n- palladium(II) [Kr]4 d 8 ; second transition series\nExercise\nCheck Your Learning Give an example of an ion from the first transition series with no d electrons.\nAnswer\nV 5+ is one possibility. Other examples include Sc 3+ , Ti 4+ , Cr 6+ , and Mn 7+ .\nTransition metals demonstrate a wide range of chemical behaviors. As can be seen from their reduction potentials ( Table P1 ), some transition metals are strong reducing agents, whereas others have very low reactivity. For example, the lanthanides all form stable 3+ aqueous cations. The driving force for such oxidations is similar to that of alkaline earth metals such as Be or Mg, forming Be 2+ and Mg 2+ . On the other hand, materials like platinum and gold have much higher reduction potentials. Their ability to resist oxidation makes them useful materials for constructing circuits and jewelry.\nIons of the lighter d -block elements, such as Cr 3+ , Fe 3+ , and Co 2+ , form colorful hydrated ions that are stable in water. However, ions in the period just below these (Mo 3+ , Ru 3+ , and Ir 2+ ) are unstable and react readily with oxygen from the air. The majority of simple, water-stable ions formed by the heavier d -block elements are oxyanions such as\n.\nRuthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, and platinum are the \" platinum metals\" . With difficulty, they form simple cations that are stable in water, and, unlike the earlier elements in the second and third transition series, they do not form stable oxyanions.\nBoth the d - and f -block elements react with nonmetals to form binary compounds; heating is often required. These elements react with halogens to form a variety of halides ranging in oxidation state from 1+ to 6+. On heating, oxygen reacts with all of the transition elements except palladium, platinum, silver, and gold. The oxides of these latter metals can be formed using other reactants, but they decompose upon heating. The f -block elements, the elements of group 3, and the elements of the first transition series except copper react with aqueous solutions of acids, forming hydrogen gas and solutions of the corresponding salts.\nActivity of the Transition Metals\nWhich is the strongest oxidizing agent in acidic solution: dichromate ion, which contains chromium(VI), permanganate ion, which contains manganese(VII), or titanium dioxide, which contains titanium(IV)?\nSolution\nFirst, we need to look up the reduction half reactions ( Table P1 ) for each oxide in the specified oxidation state:"], "citation_links": ["https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map:_General_Chemistry_%28Petrucci_et_al.%29/23:_The_Transition_Elements/23.1:_General_Properties_of_Transition_Metals"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_74452c63-b983-4e1a-a31f-620034a507a3"}

Radioimmunoassay (RIA) is an in vitro assay that measures the presence of an antigen with very high sensitivity. RIA was first described in 1960 for the measurement of endogenous plasma insulin by Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Yalow of the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York.\nThe classical RIA methods are based on the principle of competitive binding. In this method, an unlabeled antigen competes with a radiolabeled antigen for binding to an antibody with the appropriate specificity. Thus, when mixtures of radiolabeled and unlabeled antigen are incubated with the corresponding antibody, the amount of free (not bound to antibody) radiolabeled antigen is directly proportional to the quantity of unlabeled antigen in the mixture.\nTable of Contents\nRadiolabeled antigens: The antigens are generally labeled with gamma-ray emitting isotopes such as I-125 and beta-ray emitting isotopes such as Tritium. They are also called hot antigens.\nS pecific Antibodies: They are required in smaller amounts than antigens.\nUnlabeled antigens (sample antigens): They are also called cold antigens.\nM icrotitre plates: 96 wells microtitre plate\nWashing Buffer solutions: Wash buffer such as 1% Trifluoroacetic acid is used.\nMarine Project Hopes To Bring Back Oyster Population Around the UK\nAntigens and antibodies bind specifically to form the Ag-Ab complex. The antigen can be labeled or conjugated with radioisotopes. The unlabeled antigens from the sample compete with radiolabeled antigens to bind on paratopes of specific antibodies. The unlabeled antigens replace labeled antigens that are already linked with the antibodies. The unlabeled antigens when bind with antibodies, increases the amount of free radiolabeled antigens in the solution. Hence the concentration of free labeled antigens is directly proportional to the bound unlabeled antigens.\nIt involves a combination of three principles.\n- An immune reaction i.e. antigen , antibody binding.\n- A competitive binding or competitive displacement reaction. (It gives specificity)\n- Measurement of radio emission. (It gives sensitivity)\nWhen a foreign biological substance enters the body\u2019s bloodstream through a non-oral route, the body recognizes the specific chemistry on the surface of the foreign substance as antigen and produces specific antibodies against the antigen so as nullify the effects and keep the body safe. The antibodies are produced by the body\u2019s immune system so, it is an immune reaction. Here the antibodies or antigens bind and move due to chemical influence. This is different from the principle of electrophoresis where proteins are separated due to charge.\nThis is a phenomenon wherein when there are two antigens that can bind to the same antibody, the antigen with more concentration binds extensively with the limited antibody displacing others. So here in the experiment, a radiolabelled antigen is allowed to bind to a high-affinity antibody. Then when the patient serum is added to unlabeled antigens it starts binding to the antibody displacing the labeled antigen.\nOnce the incubation is over, then washings are done to remove any unbound antigens. Then radio emission of the antigen-antibody complex is taken, and the gamma rays from the radiolabeled antigen are measured.\nThe target antigen is labeled radioactively and bound to its specific antibodies (a limited and known amount of the specific antibody has to be added). A sample, for e.g. blood serum, is added in order to initiate a competitive reaction of the labeled antigens from the preparation, and the unlabeled antigens from the serum sample, with the specific antibodies. The competition for the antibodies will release a certain amount of labeled antigen. This amount is proportional to the ratio of labeled to an unlabeled antigen. A binding curve can then be generated which allows the amount of antigen in the patient\u2019s serum to be derived. That means as the concentration of unlabeled antigen is increased, more of it binds to the antibody, displacing the labeled variant. The bound antigens are then separated from the unbound ones, and the radioactivity of the free antigens remaining in the supernatant is measured.\nAntigen-antibody complexes are precipitated either by crosslinking with a second antibody or by means of the addition of reagents that promote the precipitation of antigen-antibody complexes. Counting radioactivity in the precipitates allows the determination of the amount of radiolabeled antigen precipitated with the antibody. A standard curve is constructed by plotting the percentage of antibody-bound radiolabeled antigen against known concentrations of a standardized unlabeled antigen, and the concentrations of antigen in patient samples are extrapolated from that curve.\nThe extremely high sensitivity of RIA is its major advantage .\n- Specific antibodies of known concentration are fixed in the microtitre well.\n- A known amount of hot antigens is then added to the well\n- Washed carefully to remove any unbound antigens\n- At this point, the radioactivity of the well will be maximum.\n- Unlabeled antigens are then added to the well\n- The unlabeled antigens will bind to the antibodies and there will be free labeled antigens in the well.\n- Again washed carefully to remove the free labeled antigens.\n- Radioactivity of wells is then measured by gamma-counter.\nAt first, the labeled antigens will bind to the antibodies hence radioactivity will be maximum.\nIf the sample contains specific antigens of interest, it will bind to the antibodies releasing labeled antigens and hence the radioactivity of the solution will decrease.\nSo by observation of decreasing radioactivity, it can be confirmed that the antigen of interest is present in the sample. And if the radioactivity remains the same, it can be called a negative test.\nWith the increasing concentration of unlabeled antigens, the radioactivity decreases. By plotting a graph of radioactivity(in percentage) vs concentration of unlabeled antigens, a standard curve is obtained.\nThe sample to be assayed is run parallel following a similar procedure and the radioactivity measured is calibrated with the standard curve to determine the concentration of the antigen.\n- It was first used for the detection of peptide hormones.\n- Detection of different viral antigens\n- Detection of many hormones and drugs\n- Detection of Hepatitis B surface antigens\n- Detection of mycotoxins\n- Detection of the early stage of cancer"], "citation_links": ["https://microbenotes.com/radioimmunoassay-principle-uses-and-limitations/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_257a6252-e74c-4ab2-9f9d-b650fa87485e"}

I almost closed on some land and moved for grad school. I could have set up a yurt on the land for the same amount I would have spent on just a few months of college housing. Living in a yurt was a very affordable option.\nI\u2019ve always found the modern versions of Mongolian yurts interesting. They offer a way to set up a structure quickly on a plot of land that is more than just a tent, but isn\u2019t a permanent as a building. They\u2019re an excellent solution for shelter as you\u2019re building a tiny house or setting up a homestead. Most of the time, when homesteaders buy land, they need to get on it immediately; living in a yurt presents a nice, quick option.\nIf you\u2019re considering the merits of living in a yurt, here\u2019s why living in a yurt is an excellent choice for a temporary tiny home.\nNAVIGATION\nA yurt or a \u201cMongolian yurt\u201d sounds exotic and different if you haven\u2019t heard the term. You may be wondering, what is a yurt anyway?\nThe short answer is that a yurt is essentially a round tent. These structures were native to Mongolia and were used by the nomadic groups across Mongolia and Turkey. The translation of the Turkish word \u201cyurt\u201d means \u201chome,\u201d and that\u2019s precisely what a yurt is\u2014a simple home.\nTraditional yurts were created out of wood, with a wool outer covering. These are portable homes that nomadic tribes would take with them as they herded sheep, goats, and yaks. The entire structure could be folded down and carried on a camel. It\u2019s similar to the Native American tipi.\nMongolian yurts could be quite large and include different rooms, a cooking space, and more. They were often decorated with beautiful patterns, some of which aligned with Buddhist philosophy.\nToday\u2019s yurts aren\u2019t covered in wool anymore. They\u2019re usually made out of strong tent fabric. These yurts will withstand quite a bit of use, and there are many permanent yurt-like structures throughout the United States. Many national and state parks offer permanent yurt dwellings for campers to use when visiting. Yurts are also popular across Europe in many different camp settings.\nThere are several types of yurts, and when someone refers to living in a yurt, they could be discussing any of the following:\nThe original type of traditional yurt. If you find an authentic \u201cMongolian yurt,\u201d it will likely be historical reconstruction (similar to a tipi).\nThis describes most modern yurts\u2014a lattice structure with a fabric overlay. You can buy yurt home kits online.\nThese are made entirely out of wood and are essentially a round, home structure. There\u2019s also the \u201c hexayurt ,\u201d which is a hexagonal, six-sided yurt (making it a little easier to construct than a rounded yurt).\nNo matter the type of yurt you find is best for you, it offers a fun and affordable living option. Some hexayurt kits are available for use as indoor-friendly and backyard yurts as well. These structures are made of lightweight material and could be used as classrooms, meeting spaces, or even a studio.\nWhat has always drawn me to the idea of living in a yurt was the affordability. They make great temporary houses that could last years if needed. When I was looking at using a yurt home kit as a housing option, I calculated that for less than $10,000, I could set up a nice place to live. If the land cost around $5,000, a quality yurt home kit would only cost another $3,000, making it cheaper than a few months in most other housing options.\nUltimately, I didn\u2019t end up living in a yurt, but I\u2019ve stayed in them many times, and I find many of the traditional yurts beautiful. With a wide range of yurt home kits available, you can set up a yurt with very little assistance. It only takes two or three people to get it set up and can come together fast.\nBy and large, yurts are better as temporary structures. Living in a permanent yurt is an option in climates that are very temperate all year long, but a modern fabric yurt (from a yurt home kit) will degrade in 5-10 years. The fabric molds and mildews eventually.\nYou can think of a yurt as a step up from a tent\u2014a \u201cglamping\u201d option with more space than an RV. It\u2019s more affordable than most RVs too, but living in a yurt forever probably isn\u2019t a realistic option. If you\u2019re looking for a long-term home, a tiny house is a much more viable choice.\nYurts are essentially round tent-like structures. They can be enormous, with multiple rooms and spaces just like a typical home. Yurts are circular, which can be challenging from a design and decorating perspective, but they\u2019re also very sturdy and practical as temporary or semi-permanent yurt homes.\nIf you\u2019re planning to build a yurt, it\u2019s essential to understand the structure so you know exactly what to expect. Even if you\u2019re living in it for a short time, you\u2019ll want a yurt to be well-built and structurally sound.\nTraditional yurts were homes for nomads, who built the base of the house right on the ground. Today\u2019s yurt owners usually set up a pre-made wooden base for their homes. Companies sell pre-made insulated bases consisting of SIPs (structurally insulated panels).\nConstructing the base of a yurt is the most challenging part of building. The base must be level, which requires some intense labor. It\u2019s also surprisingly more complex to build a circular base. Some folks opt for a big square and then build up a smaller circular base on top.\nThe base fabric of the yurt will need to tie into a circular base to ensure that it\u2019s air-tight and free of bugs and pests (like a round peg in a square hole\u2014a square base will leave gaps). Pre-made SIP yurt bases are typically the way to go. They\u2019re insulated, and you can get the right size for what you need.\nOnce you\u2019ve established a solid, insulated base, you\u2019ll need to construct the wooden lattice walls. Some yurt builders prefer to work with bamboo, and either construction works well. It depends on where you live and what you prefer.\nMany yurt kits include space for windows that zip closed and have a mesh screen. These are nice for ventilation and a cross-breeze in your yurt. Most yurts feature a traditional wooden front door too. You can use electric in your yurt ( see my guide on setting up electric ) just like a tiny house, so an air conditioner is also possible.\nShould you buy a pre-made lattice for your yurt? Yes! While there are plans out there to show you how to build your own lattice, it\u2019s very time-consuming (even if you\u2019re a capable woodworker). Look at the value of your time. Even if you can do the construction yourself, you could earn quite a bit more by working with that time and buying your lattice walls from a yurt manufacturing company.\nRafters usually come along with the lattice in a wood yurt kit. Companies like Pacific Yurts sell well-made yurt home kits that help you through the building process. You could go through the build yourself, but unlike a tiny house, it\u2019s usually much less expensive to invest in a wooden yurt kit and save yourself time and effort.\nYurt rafters come in a pair. There\u2019s a wire that weaves between every other top part of the lattice, and then the rafters have a notch, which you place over the wire. The top usually doesn\u2019t come together but hooks into a metal piece that forms an operable skylight (compression ring).\nAt the center of the top of the yurt, the compression ring holds the yurt together. Usually, this center ring is covered by a domed skylight. The yurt\u2019s compression ring will also be included in most yurt home kits, and it\u2019s an essential component.\nIt would take you too long to build the bones of the yurt yourself, not to mention the engineering required and the cost of materials. Lumber is at an all-time high price and buying the lattice, rafters, and compression ring from a manufacturer is the best choice.\nUnlike Mongolian yurts of old, most of the covers are made of waterproof vinyl or canvas backed with felt or foil insulation instead of the traditional yurt cover of wool. If you\u2019re having any questions about buying the extra layers of insulation, you should go for it.\nEven if you don\u2019t live in the coldest climate, any insulation will help keep the weather out (heat and cool). The cover has some insulation similar to bubble wrap with foil on either side. Most of the time, it\u2019s rated at an R3 or 5, which is about 20% of the code. It\u2019s well worth the price to increase your comfort with extra insulation.\nIf you\u2019re ready to try living in a yurt, the first step will likely be to select a yurt kit and decide where you\u2019d like to set up your yurt on your property. Look for a flat area of land that\u2019s large enough to accommodate a yurt. There is a range of sizes, up to a 50-foot yurt and beyond. So like a tiny house, select the size that meets your needs (especially if it\u2019s a long-term temporary dwelling).\nYou can build the platform yourself. It\u2019s very similar to building a deck like you\u2019d set up on the side of a house. Eventually, you could even use this platform as a spot to set up a deck area for your tiny house. If you\u2019d like a semi-permanent structure, it\u2019s worth it to hire a deck company. Most will come to any field and build you one.\nThe easy thing about a yurt home kit is that it usually comes with detailed steps and instructions. Keep in mind that you probably won\u2019t be able to set up a yurt fully by yourself. It will take around 2-3 days once the base is built and requires several people. It\u2019s more involved than setting up even an elaborate tent.\nIf you go the DIY route, there are many DIY yurt guides online to help . My advice would be to consider the time and effort you\u2019re going to put into a temporary home. Building a yurt from a kit isn\u2019t terribly expensive and is a much better investment of your time and money.\nEven with a kit, you will need to plan out several days and several helping hands. However, you won\u2019t need a whole bunch of tools outside of a drill, screwdrivers, a level, post-hole digger, shovel, and string. Remember that nomadic farmers who built Mongolian yurts needed to set up a dwelling without much effort or many tools.\nStart with the base \u2013 The base is one of the biggest challenges of setting up a yurt kit because it must be dead flat. As I explained above, most yurt dwellers prefer to set up a deck-type platform, then a round flooring base on top to ensure the yurt is completely secure. You may want to put down a moisture barrier on the ground to keep the floor extra dry. Skirting and a drip edge are also a good idea for the floor.\nSet up the door and the lattice walls \u2013 You will nail the lattice walls into the base to form a sturdy structure. This is one part of the yurt building where you\u2019ll need multiple people\u2014at least one person to hold and one person to nail. The tension cable will go around the top of the lattice walls.\nSet up the rafters \u2013 You will secure the rafters to the tension ring in the center. You will need a platform to hold up the tension ring until all the rafters are completely in place. Brace each rafter against the ring as the yurt is constructed.\nSet up the walls with additional support structures, if preferred \u2013 The walls may require additional support beams to ensure that the yurt stays steady and strong. The bones of the yurt can last for many years (beyond the fabric outside), so solid construction is essential, especially if it\u2019s a semi-permanent or permanent yurt.\nSet up the insulation layer \u2013 The insulation layer goes on next, which typically starts by covering the roof and then moving down the sidewalls. Again, it depends on your planned use, climate, and the yurt kit you purchase, but you may also insulate the walls.\nPut up the outer fabric walls \u2013 The outer fabric walls go around the yurt to form the walls of your new yurt home. The window vents will let in a nice breeze, and your yurt should be fully livable at this point.\nFrame interior walls as preferred \u2013 Depending on how detailed you want to get with your interior construction, you can frame in the walls, include a bathroom, install lighting, countertops, storage, and more. If your yurt is your home for a few years, it may be worth it to go ahead with the framing and interior build-out. If you\u2019re using it as a temporary dwelling, then bare bones may be the way to go.\nHere\u2019s a great example of setting up a yurt kit (with an elaborate interior design).\nWhether you build a yurt yourself or buy a yurt kit, there are advantages and disadvantages to living in a yurt. Here are a few challenges of yurt living to consider before you commit.\nI recommend always having the installation manual from your yurt home kit handy to help you navigate code enforcement. If local building code enforcement should question the structure, you\u2019ll be able to show them how you plan to affix the yurt to your platform or how it will perform in high winds or storms. The manual is a great backup. Choose your words carefully; rather than saying, \u201cI want to live in this,\u201d explain that it\u2019s a temporary house.\nBuying a kit will allow you to check everything out before you build. If your code enforcement isn\u2019t okay with the yurt structure, you\u2019ll know before you\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours constructing a platform, creating a lattice, and setting up your yurt. Learn more about yurt building codes here .\nAnother challenge of living in a yurt is insulation. You\u2019ll only be able to get up to an insulation rating of 5, which is basically the same as a sturdy tent. If you live in a climate with a lot of rain or humidity, you\u2019re going to battle dampness and moisture continuously. So living in a yurt in a rainy climate like the pacific northwest could be a challenge.\nIf you live in a very cold climate, the insulation will not offer much protection from the weather, either. The insulation isn\u2019t nearly as strong as a house, and even with a heater, it will get very cold. Similarly, hot weather can be a challenge too. Although, if you go ahead and wire the yurt for electricity, a fan or small air conditioner can keep you pretty cool. Yurts are well-ventilated, so warmer climates are your best option.\nYurts aren\u2019t secure. Period. It\u2019s a piece of fabric on a wood lattice, so it\u2019s not an extremely sound structure against outside forces. A hexayurt made of wood may offer some additional security, but not much.\nIf you live in an area where hurricanes or tornados are prevalent, then a yurt is probably not a safe or practical option. While it\u2019s safer than a tent and will keep out some basic natural forces, it\u2019s not going to be as secure as a house.\nThe wood yurt kits are very heavy and impossible to move on your own. It\u2019s not wise to attempt to build a yurt by yourself (even from a kit). When you order the yurt kit, you\u2019ll need to plan on appropriate delivery transportation. You may receive the kit via freight, but you may need to rent a lift gate or mini forklift to move the kit.\nIf you\u2019re a homesteader, a tractor may also be an option for moving the yurt kit. Sometimes land can be inaccessible to delivery drivers, too, so it\u2019s essential to have a plan of how you\u2019ll get your kit to your foundation.\nYurt fabrics have a shelf-life of about 5-10 years. At that point, you\u2019ll need to invest in a new cover. While the shells are affordable, they\u2019ll degrade over time, and you\u2019ll need to replace them and perform upkeep and repairs.\nIf you build your yurt carefully, with a strong structure, then it can last a very long time. But keep in mind, you\u2019ll probably need to continue to replace the fabric roof, walls, and possibly the insulation layer regularly.\nFrom a decorating and design perspective, the yurt\u2019s curved walls are tricky. You can\u2019t put a couch against a curved wall. You can\u2019t hang things from latticework or the fabric. You also shouldn\u2019t have anything flush against the wall because it\u2019s a tent\u2014you\u2019ll want ventilation for drying should the walls get wet.\nThe workaround with a yurt is to either opt for a hexayurt with wooden, flat walls (basically a hexagonal tiny house) or to build a nice, sturdy interior structure with walls as partitions. I\u2019ve seen some elaborate layouts, and I\u2019ve listed several ideas for yurt layouts here.\nAssuming you go with a yurt home kit to build your yurt, you\u2019ll look at a kit price range between $4,000 and $13,000 . It will depend on the size of your kit, the materials, and what\u2019s included with the kit.\nYurt kits generally range from about 12-foot yurts to 30-foot yurts. Some larger kits will even build a 50-foot yurt, so there\u2019s quite a large selection. Keep in mind that the price of the kit is usually just for the lattice, roof, tension ring, and outer fabric. The extras for your yurt will usually cost more.\nMost kits don\u2019t include the base or foundation, so you\u2019ll need to figure in the price of building a deck and platform. They won\u2019t have heating or HVAC, water, a power hookup, or any amenities for building out and furnishing the inside.\nStill, for around $10,000 (especially if you already own the land), a yurt offers an ideal temporary home for months or even years as you work on building a tiny house or setting up a homestead.\nI\u2019ve created some layout design ideas to help you brainstorm the ways to set up your yurt. Because the structures are pretty versatile, you can set up space for one or two people to simply sleep or an extensive more permanent yurt home.\nA 12-foot yurt home is a cozy but comfortable room for a single person or could be set up for two people as a temporary weekend camp. A small yurt will make a lovely guest dwelling if you\u2019re looking for a way to host people at your tiny house.\nA slightly larger 14-foot yurt has room for a bed, a sink, small table, or chair for lounging. The 14-foot sized yurt is a better option for couples who would like a little more room in their yurt.\nA 16-foot yurt layout is roomy enough for a bathroom and a bedroom. With a partition wall, you could split up space into a studio-like living area. A 16-foot yurt is an ample option for a single person but room enough for a couple to use as a weekend getaway.\nA 20-foot yurt is roomy and comfortable enough for even a small family to make as a temporary home. As you can see from this layout, there\u2019s room for a kitchen, a bathroom, and a small lounge area. With a futon or foldout couch, you could sleep up to four in this yurt.\nA 24-foot yurt offers a really good amount of space for a family to use as a semi-permanent yurt home. Using inner walls to create partitions, you could divide the space into several rooms with some storage, lounge areas, and a spacious bathroom.\nA 30-foot or even a 50-foot yurt kit offers a significant amount of living space. You could easily have enough room for a small family for several months or a couple as a long-term or permanent yurt. If you build out the deck beyond the boundaries of the yurt walls, you could use the extra porch area for cooking and entertaining.\nThe interior needs of a yurt are pretty similar to those of a tiny house. If you have a bathroom or kitchen in your yurt, you will want to have access to hookups just like you would in your tiny home. The big difference is that with the fabric walls, your utilities will need to run on the interior.\nMany yurt owners put interior walls in the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom to set up outlets and run utilities through there. As far as bathroom plumbing, composting toilets are a very popular option amongst yurt owners.\nBesides being inexpensive, fun, and easy to build, the other big draw of a yurt is that it\u2019s easy to build a yurt off-grid. For homesteaders and those looking for a temporary dwelling while they finish building their dream tiny home, a yurt is very appealing.\nHere are a few examples of yurt interior design to inspire you.\nThe walls that break up the interior of your yurt are more like room dividers. Most leave some space between the top of the wall and the ceiling. You can use the interior walls for electric and as a spot to hang storage and even d\u00e9cor.\nWood stoves are practical for off-grid living and many folks like them for yurts. Not only do they offer heat, but there are some beautiful choices too. You\u2019ll need to consider how you plan to run the flue pipe through the canvas exterior. Some yurt kits come with a flue pipe option.\nThe most common choices for yurt kitchen design are L-shaped or galley kitchens. Typically, you\u2019ll want to put your kitchen up against an interior partition wall since your utilities will be on the interior. Otherwise, a yurt kitchen is similar to other tiny house kitchens .\nThere are several options for yurt windows\u2014you can have clear vinyl sewn into the outer fabric shell, you can use the screened windows that are part of the outer shell, or you can build in an actual window. Real windows are beautiful, efficient, and functional, but they\u2019re more costly to install.\nReady to try a yurt home for yourself? Here are the best yurt home kit brands to choose from.

The Lemon Pepper Seasoning really gives the Tilapia so much flavor.\n00:00\n01:26\nCooking the Tilapia in foil helps perfectly flaky, flavorful fish every time. This fish recipe has been our go-to this summer. It is light and healthy and every one loves it. I like to pair this Grilled Tilapia with some summer vegetables and rice to complete the meal.\nIt is quick and easy dinner idea that saves me time and money. The seasoning is a staple ingredient and the process to make these Grilled Tilapia is less than 10 minutes.\nThe best way from keeping your tilapia from falling through the grill grates, is to cook the tilapia in foil. Cooking the Tilapia in foil also prevents the tilapia from sticking to the grates.\nCooking in foil is a great way to add in cherry tomatoes with your Tilapia. It also keeps the moisture locked in which results in flavorful fish. You still get the flavors of grilling your fish but keeping it in foil allows you to enjoy it even more.\n- Tilapia fillets\n- Lemon Pepper Seasoning\n- Olive Oil\n- Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil.\n- Prepare Foil \u2013 Tear the foil into 6 equal pieces for each tilapia filet.\n- Add Tilapia \u2013 Place a tilapia filet on each piece of foil.\n- Prepare Grill \u2013 Preheat the outdoor grill over medium high heat (approximately 400 degrees F).\n- Season Tilapia in Foil \u2013 Drizzle the olive oil over each filet and sprinkle each one with approximately \u00bd tsp Lemon Pepper Seasoning. You can also use cooking spray.\n- Prepare the Foil \u2013 Fold up the sides and the top of the foil to make a foil pack.\n- Grill Tilapia in Foil \u2013 Place directly on the grill for 8-10 minutes until the tilapia reaches an internal temperature for 145 degrees F.\n- Serve and Enjoy \u2013 Be careful when unwrapping the foil packets and then the tilapia is ready to enjoy. Season with salt and black pepper and serve.\nIn just 8 minutes, you will have the absolute best meal. It is easy to tell when this Lemon Pepper Grilled Tilapia is done.\nIt really only takes a few minutes per side and dinner is ready. You will love having such a quick and easy recipe to cook.\nTilapia is white fish when it is raw but it is more of a translucent white. You know when Tilapia is cooked and ready to eat when the white becomes more of a solid white it flakes easily with a fork.\nHeat your grill to medium high heat so that the fish will sear. You want the internal temperature of the fish to be 145 degrees. We recommend using a meat thermometer to make sure that the Tilapia is done.\nFish obviously isn\u2019t the cheapest meat to eat, but Tilapia is one of the \u201cnicer\u201d fish that is lesser expensive.\nIf you want to save money on it, then do like our family and buy it in bulk. You will save at least $1 or $2 per pound by buying it frozen in bulk than fresh.\nIf you are afraid of fish, then try Tilapia. I think you will be impressed with how \u201cnon fishy\u201d it tastes.\nSome of our family really does not care for fish and they like Tilapia. It has a great flavor and the lemon pepper really jazzes it up.\nYes, you can use a fish grilling basket like these , for around $20. Those are nice for a \u201ccrispier\u201d fish crust, but for tilapia, I like it nice and juicy. Instead we use foil packets.\nYou can also use a grill pan if you prefer.\nWe buy our Tilapia at Sam\u2019s because it is individually packaged and it is very convenient. We take it out of the freezer, run water over it to loosen the package and place it right in our foil pack and straight to the grill.\nThere is no need to thaw! I just love this easy tilapia recipe. This is such a big help when we need dinner fast.\nFor our seasoning this time, we used lemon pepper seasoning. You can buy it almost in any store for just a few dollars and it tastes amazing on fish and chicken.\nTear your foil so that you have enough for each piece of tilapia. Drizzle the foil with olive oil, put the fish inside and top with lemon pepper seasoning. You can seasoning to a bowl and whisk then drizzle over tilapia.\nIf you don\u2019t have lemon seasoning, you can use what you have. It is also flavorful with salt and pepper and garlic powder.\nRefrigerate any leftover tilapia in an airtight container for up to 3-4 days.\nDinners that are super quick like this recipe help make busy seasons of life less hectic. My family can still enjoy a great meal without any prep work at all.\nYou can get dinner on the table in 10 minutes.\nWant to save this recipe?"], "citation_links": ["https://www.eatingonadime.com/lemon-pepper-grilled-tilapia/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_3401ae9b-5da5-4812-a6cf-71feff7b40d6"}

{"question": "Should religious education be taught in public schools?", "claim": "There is debate over whether religion should be taught in public schools.", "claim_raw_string": "There is debate over whether religion should be taught in public schools.", "response": "There is debate over whether religion should be taught in public schools. While it is legal to study religious texts in public schools for educational purposes, some argue that teaching religion amounts to religious indoctrination and is prohibited.", "references": ["For Educators\nPublic schools may not teach religion, although teaching about religion in a secular context is permitted. 1 The Bible may be taught in a school, but only for its historical, cultural or literary value and never in a devotional, celebratory or doctrinal manner, or in such a way that encourages acceptance of the Bible as a religious document. 2\nReligion may be presented as part of a secular educational program. Programs that \"teach about religion\" are geared toward teaching students about the role of religion in the historical, cultural, literary and social development of the United States and other nations. These programs should instill understanding, tolerance and respect for a pluralistic society. When discussing religion in this context, religion must be discussed in a neutral, objective, balanced and factual manner. Such programs should educate students about the principle of religious liberty as one of the fundamental elements of freedom and democracy in the United States.\n\"Teaching religion\" amounts to religious indoctrination or practice and is clearly prohibited in public schools. A public school curriculum may not be devotional or doctrinal. 3 Nor may it have the effect of promoting or inhibiting religion. A teacher must not promote or denigrate any particular religion, religion in general, or lack of religious belief. 4 A teacher must not interject personal views or advocate those of certain students. Teachers must be extremely sensitive to respect, and not interfere with, a student's religious beliefs and practices. Students must not be encouraged to accept or conform to specific religious beliefs or practices. A program intended to teach religion, disguised as teaching about religion, will be found unconstitutional. 5\nIn sum, there is a critical difference between teaching religion and teaching about religion. While it is constitutionally permissible for public schools to teach about religion, it is unconstitutional for public schools and their employees to observe religious holidays, promote religious belief, or practice religion. School officials and parents must be extremely careful not to cross the line between \"the laudable educational goal of promoting a student's knowledge of and appreciation for this nation's cultural and religious diversity, and the impermissible endorsement of religion forbidden by the Establishment Clause.\" 6\nThe Bible may be studied as literature, but not as religious doctrine. The lesson must be secular, religiously neutral and objective. 7 Classes on the Bible as literature should be optional. 8 The Anti-Defamation League strongly suggests that such classes be taught by school personnel who have some training in Establishment Clause issues.\nSchools may indeed and should teach secular values such as honesty, respect for others, courage, kindness and good citizenship. These values, however, must not be taught as religious tenets. The fact that most religions also teach these values does not change the lawfulness and desirability of teaching them. It is also appropriate for school officials to instill in students such values as \"independent thought, tolerance of diverse views, self-respect, maturity, self-reliance and logical decision-making.\" 9\nAlthough it is legal to teach about religion in public schools in a neutral and secular manner, school administrators, teachers and parents should be cognizant of the inherent dangers of bringing religion into the classroom. 10 Public school teachers should carefully consider the following factors:\n- Students are extremely susceptible to peer and public pressure and coercion. This concern is heightened, of course, at the elementary school level. Any discussion of religion in the classroom should be sensitive to the beliefs of the different students in the class. No student should be made to feel that his or her personal beliefs or practices are being questioned, infringed upon or compromised. A student should never feel ostracized on the basis of his or her religious beliefs.\n- If religion is discussed, great care must be taken to discuss minority as well as majority religions. The inclusion of only the major religions in a classroom discussion does not reflect the actual religious diversity within our society and the world. Cursory discussions will subtly denigrate the validity of minority religious beliefs held by some individuals, regardless of whether adherents to minority beliefs are represented in the class. If they are present, these students may feel excluded or coerced.\n- Students should not be put on the spot to explain their religious (or cultural) traditions. The student may feel uncomfortable and may not have enough information to be accurate. Moreover, by asking a student to be spokesperson for his or her religion, the teacher is sending a signal that the religion is too \"exotic\" for the teacher to understand. Finally, in certain cases, the teacher may be opening the door for proselytizing activity by the student, which must be avoided.\n- Every effort should be made to obtain accurate information about different religions. Special training may be required to prepare teachers to discuss religion in an appropriate manner.\n- Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those students who are being raised with no religious faith. While there is an obligation for even these students to learn what is being taught as part of a secular educational program, it is very important that teachers avoid discussions that seem to endorse religious belief over non-religious belief. Otherwise, such students may feel pressure to conform to the majority, or be made to feel inferior about their own upbringing.\n- Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those who are being raised with orthodox religious faiths. It is equally important that teachers not appear to disapprove of faith, thereby alienating those who are raised with faith.\nNo. Public schools can require that all students use a prescribed set of textbooks if the books neither promote nor oppose any religious practice. The students must only be required to read and discuss the material and may not be required to perform or refrain from performing any act forbidden or mandated by their religion. Mere exposure to ideas that one finds objectionable on religious grounds does not rise to the level of a free exercise claim that compelled activity would. 11\nThe state may not establish a \"religion of secularism\" in the sense that the state may not affirmatively oppose or show hostility to religion, thereby preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe. 12 That being said, the prohibition on teaching religion and religious activity ensures that the government does not advance or promote religious belief over non-religious belief or a particular religious belief over other religious beliefs. 13 Simply, the public schools should work to ensure that they do not endorse or disapprove religion, neither promoting nor denigrating it.\nThis is as much a free speech issue as it is a religious liberty issue. Where a student responds to an assignment (for example, a book report) with a religiously-themed project (for example, reporting on a religious tract), a school may not refuse to accept the assignment solely because it has a religious basis (students have a right to free expression). 14 However, if in observing the presentation of the assignment -- especially expressive assignments like artwork, plays and reports that are presented publicly -- an observer might think that the project is endorsed by the school, it is a problem. 15 Thus, a book report delivered to a teacher may not be rejected merely because it is religious, whereas a work of art that will be hung up or displayed by the school or a play intended for public performance is unacceptable. Indeed, educators are able to exercise considerable control over \"student expression to assure that participants learn whatever lessons the activity is designed to teach, that readers or listeners are not exposed to material that may be inappropriate for their level of maturity, and that the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school.\" 16\nMr. Clark's sixth grade class used a standard reader which had stories on a wide variety of topics. One passage in the reader involved the first settlers in the \"new world,\" and another described Leonardo da Vinci as the human with a creative mind that \"came closest to the divine touch.\" Talia Berk, a student in Mr. Clark's class, was interested in the passage about the first settlers and asked how the religious beliefs and practices of these settlers compared with those of the Native American Indians.\nHow should Mr. Clark answer Talia's question on the settlers?\nAfter researching the question, the teacher may explain the answer to Talia in a secular, objective and nondoctrinal manner, or recommend a book on the subject which is secular, unbiased and nondoctrinal.\nJoe Smith, also a student in Mr. Clark's class, showed the reader referenced in the prior scenario to his mother, who became very upset with the passage on Leonardo da Vinci, since she viewed it as contrary to her religious beliefs. Joe's mother asked Mr. Clark to excuse Joe from using the reader. Mr. Clark, unsure of how to respond to Mrs. Smith's request, went to the principal to seek guidance.\nShould Joe be exempted from using the standard reader?\nThe school should not excuse Joe from using the standard reader. However, the school must ensure that the standard reader neither promotes nor opposes religion, and that Joe is merely required to read and discuss the material and is not required to perform or refrain from performing any act forbidden or mandated by his religion.\nMr. Parker, who is not Jewish, is afraid that he will mischaracterize Hanukkah when he is explaining about holidays. In class, he calls on a Jewish student to see if she would be willing to explain to the class the meaning of Hanukkah. She tries to do so. Later that day, the student tells her mother about the incident, who objects to Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker proposes that the mother come to class and explain Hanukkah. She agrees and comes to school and performs a holiday-foods cooking demonstration.\nShould Mr. Parker have asked the student to explain Hanukkah? Should he have asked her mother?\nBy asking the student, Mr. Parker singled her out from her peers and made Hanukkah seem too exotic for him to explain. It is also unlikely that many students would have the requisite knowledge to give an accurate answer. By asking the mother, Mr. Parker rightly shifted the burden off of the student to an adult. However, he must make sure that the presentation given by the mother is neutral, objective and fits in with a broader lesson plan concerning the holidays. Better still, Mr. Parker could avail himself of one of the many books about Hanukkah and prepare himself to teach the lesson.\n1 School Dist. of Abington Township, Pa. v.

They also faulted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for moving too slowly to allow competing products to reach the market.\nU.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, ranking Democrat on the committee, said Mylan \u201cjacked up\u201d the price of the product \u201cto get filthy rich at the expense of our constituents.\u201d He questioned whether Mylan would change course in any way following the backlash over its pricing.\n\u201cAfter Mylan takes our punches they\u2019ll fly back to their mansions in their private jets and laugh all the way to the bank,\u201d Cummings said.\nBresch defended the price hikes, saying that after rebates, marketing costs and other expenses, Mylan earns about $100 for a pair of EpiPens. She emphasized that the company plans a half-price version of the device, that it provides them free to many schools and said that Mylan\u2019s generic medications combined have saved the U.S. healthcare system $180 billion in costs over a decade.\n\u201cOur concern was absolutely that anyone who needs an EpiPen has one,\u201d Bresch told the hearing. Mylan will also soon seek approval for a new formulation that extends the shelf life of EpiPen from 18 months to at least 24 months, cutting down replacement costs, Bresch said.\nThe EpiPen is an automatic injector, delivering a dose of the generic medicine epinephrine through a quick jab in the thigh. It commands over 90 percent of the market, with no competition expected until next year at the earliest.\n\u201cI am a very conservative, pro-business Republican, but I am really sickened by what I ... heard here today,\u201d Representative John J. Duncan Jr. of Tennessee said at Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\nThe EpiPen price increases ignited a national controversy in August following complaints by families. Congressional lawmakers have called on federal agencies to investigate Mylan\u2019s business practices.\nSeveral U.S. states are probing the impact of the price increases on government healthcare programs such as Medicaid. The pricing furor has hurt company shares, bringing them to a historically low valuation. [nL2N1BW14K]\nAt the hearing, Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah questioned why Mylan could now afford to offer a generic version of EpiPen for about $300.\n\u201cSuddenly, feeling the heat, Mylan has offered a generic version and cut the price in half, so that does beg the question what was happening with that other $300?\u201d\nHolding up an EpiPen, he said: \u201cthe actual juice that\u2019s in here that you need costs about a dollar.\u201d\nIn 2015, EpiPen accounted for $1 billion of Mylan\u2019s overall sales of $9.45 billion and about 20 percent of company profit. Critics say EpiPen would remain profitable at a lower price.\nA recent analysis by the consumer watchdog Public Citizen found that an EpiPen two-pack costs $69 in the United Kingdom, $181.81 in Canada and $210.21 in Germany.\nLawmakers are trying to determine whether Mylan made more money on EpiPen than warranted from state Medicaid programs by having it classified as a generic product, resulting in much smaller rebates to the government health plans.\nThe FDA classifies EpiPen as branded but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services deems it a generic for the purposes of Medicaid\u2019s drug rebate program. Participating companies pay 13 percent in rebates on generic drugs versus 23 percent on branded products.\nMylan has said it complied with all laws and regulations regarding rebates.\nEpiPen has also increased the cost burden to the Medicare program for the elderly, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group. Before rebates, EpiPen costs for Medicare Part D increased more than 1,000 percent between 2007 and 2014, from $7 million to $87.9 million, the report said.\nAdditional reporting by Caroline Humer in New York"], "citation_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mylan-nl-epipen-congress/u-s-lawmakers-blast-mylan-ceo-over-sickening-epipen-price-hikes-idUSKCN11R2OG"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_c1e00513-d679-4435-b115-76ad38f3b591"}
{"question": "identify termite", "claim": "When they swarm, they shed their wings.", "claim_raw_string": "When they swarm, they shed their wings.", "response": "Termites are small insects that can cause damage to homes and other wooden structures. They have a straight waist, straight antennae, and shorter legs. When they swarm, they shed their wings.", "references": ["Every year, termites cause more than $5 billion in property damage in the United States. Termites are known as \u201csilent destroyers\u201d because of their ability to chew through wood, flooring and even wallpaper undetected for years\u2014damage that isn\u2019t covered by most homeowners insurance policies.\nAs spring approaches and the ground begins to warm across the country, termite populations will emerge in search of new structures to invade. Starting from South to North, termite explorers, referred to as swarmers, will look for hospitable homes, with buildings that have sustained damage from severe winter weather particularly at risk. Once swarmers have determined your home to be a good fit, it\u2019s likely that the rest of the termite colony will follow, resulting in a full-blown termite infestation.\nBy becoming familiar with the species of termites that are most prevalent in their area along with their habits, homeowners are better equipped to detect the warning signs of an infestation, and call in a pest professional to assist with termite identification before the problem gets out of hand. Here\u2019s a handy guide to help you learn how to spot termites in your home and identify their species correctly.\nMany people will see termite swarmers in homes during the spring and mistake them for flying ants; this can end up being a costly mistake if the rest of the termite colony follows the swarmers. Winged termites have a straight waist, straight antennae and their wings are equal in size. Flying ants on the other hand have waists that are pinched in the middle, bent antennae and two sets of wings, with the top set being larger than the lower. Termites are also most likely to swarm in the spring, while flying ants may swarm at various times of the year.\nFound in every U.S. state except Alaska, subterranean termites are creamy white to dark brown or black and 1/8 inch long. They live in underground colonies or in moist secluded areas aboveground that can contain up to two million members. Subterranean termites also build telltale \u201cmud tubes\u201d to gain access to food sources and protect themselves from the open air. This termite species is considered to be by far the most destructive of all termites throughout the United States. Using their saw-toothed mandibles to bite off tiny pieces of wood, one piece at a time, they can chew through wood 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If subterranean termites are left unchecked, they have the ability to cause significant structural damage to a building, even causing a total collapse in some cases.\nFormosan termites are similar in color to subterranean termites but can grow to 1/2 an inch long. They can be found in Hawaii, California and much of the southern U.S. Originally from China, Formosan termites are the most aggressive known termite species, capable of consuming one foot of 2X4 wood in just 25 days. They live in huge underground colonies with an average of 350,000 workers and build intricate mud nests inside the walls of a structure. This species is known as the most aggressive termite, able to rapidly reproduce and cause significant damage. In fact, a mature Formosan termite colony can cause severe structural damage to a home in as little as six months and queens can birth over 1,000 eggs each. In addition to wood, this species can damage electric cable insulation and telephone coverages, potentially leading to costly damage and power outages.\nDampwood termites can be spotted throughout the pacific coastal and adjacent states, the desert or semi-arid southwest, and in southern Florida. This termite species is typically between 1/2 and 5/8 of an inch long. As their name suggests, dampwood termites infest wood with high moisture content, such as dead trees or logs, and don\u2019t usually infest structures because of their need for excessive moisture. However, it is important to avoid attracting them as they can cause serious property damage if they make themselves at home. They're known to be attracted to water-damaged household areas, like spaces suffering from cracked drainpipes or roof leaks. If they get inside a structure, they will hide inside wooden support beams and conceal their entry holes with their own feces.\nUnlike subterranean and Formosan termites, drywood termites do not require contact with the soil and usually infest undecayed wood. They are typically between 3/8 and one inch long and often establish nests in roof materials and wooden wall supports, along with dead wood that may be around the home. This species can even infest wood furniture and framing if they gain inside access. As such, they can easily and unknowlingly be transported in wood items from one location to another. They are found in the southern states, from North Carolina through the Gulf Coast and in to the coastal areas of California. They form colonies of up to 2,500 members and usually swarm on sunny, warm days after a sudden rise in temperature.\nNamed for the cone-shaped head their soldiers have, conehead termites travel above ground similar to ants, rather than via underground tunnels like other species. Doing so allows them to travel much faster and efficiently than termites that utilize underground pathways or build \"mud tubes.\" If this species gains entry to a home, they can still construct tunnels through walls and wood flooring, allowing them to potentially go unnoticed for long periods of time. Although conehead termites are primarily found in various southern regions of Florida, any infestation could possibly have a significant impact on the structural integrity of a building.\nIt\u2019s not always possible for an untrained eye to spot evidence of termites, but homeowners should keep a look-out for the certain signs of termites that can help them identify a termite infestation.

Central to the debate has been the challenge of accommodating what may appear to be opposing principles\u2014the protection of children from unsuitable media content and upholding the right to freedom of expression.\nIn the U.S., where television began as a commercial enterprise, the First Amendment, ensuring free speech and freedom of the press, has been used forcefully to argue against any government intervention in the operation of media organizations.\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights also guarantees freedom of expression, but it embodies a greater acceptance that reasonable limits can be placed on individual rights for the greater good of society. In Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and many European countries, television followed on the heels of state-owned radio and began with the premise that any enterprise using public airwaves had a social responsibility. This premise from the 1950s may seem somewhat archaic in today\u2019s competitive media environment, but in Canada, it provided the foundation for a public policy framework to address media violence.\nCanadian government and industry initiatives on television violence\nCanada has long been the largest importer of American television programming. This is due to its geographical proximity to the U.S., as well as an inability to produce profitable programming for a small domestic market.\nViolence in this programming had become a public policy issue by the 1970s, but it was the deregulation of children\u2019s programming in the U.S. and the emergence of the VCR during the 1980s that led to a substantial increase in public concern about the issue. Children\u2019s TV programming, especially cartoons, suddenly became less benign, and children and young teens had access to adult fare that had previously been denied to them in theatres.\nIn the early 1990s, the federal broadcast regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), began consultations on the issues relating to television violence with the broadcasting, cable and program production industries, as well as public health professionals, educators, policy-makers and consumer groups. At the same time, following several tragic \u201cflashpoints\u201d which were mistakenly attributed to media violence, a petition against it signed by 1.3 million Canadians was presented to the Prime Minister.\nIn 1993, a symposium hosted by the C.M. Hincks Institute for Children\u2019s Mental Health brought together all of the stakeholders. The industry-based Action Group on Violence on Television (AGVOT) was formed at this symposium and soon after, the Canadian Association of Broadcasters (CAB) filed with the CRTC a revised code on violence in broadcasting which all privately-owned conventional television stations and networks would ultimately be obliged to follow. [1] This code is reviewed every five years.\nThe Code\u2019s provisions include:\n- a prohibition on airing programs that are gratuitously violent and that promote or glamorize violent acts\n- a \u201cwatershed hour\u201d of 9:00 p.m. before which only violence suitable for children could be aired\n- a promise to develop a program classification system\n- a commitment to sensitivity about violence against vulnerable groups, such as women and minorities\n- a statement that violence would not be shown as a preferred way of solving problems or as the central theme of children\u2019s programming and that children\u2019s programming would not invite dangerous imitation\nThe CAB also established the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC), an industry self-regulatory body mandated to respond to complaints from the public about violence and other matters. If a complaint is dealt with satisfactorily through the self-regulatory process, it is not included on the CRTC\u2019s public record that is reviewed at licence renewal time for the station/network involved. If not resolved, complaints are brought to the federal regulator.\nIn late 1993, after a two-day meeting hosted by the CRTC, representatives of Canadian parent and teacher organizations recommended the formation of an online clearinghouse for resources on media education and information on media issues. This resulted in the formation of the Media Awareness Network under the aegis of the National Film Board of Canada. This organization would, in 2012, become MediaSmarts.\nIn June 1994, the V-chip entered the picture as a technological tool that parents could use to control children\u2019s exposure to televised violence. The V-chip effectively gave users the ability to block all content on their televisions that failed to meet a certain age-rating. The CRTC ultimately ensured that foreign signals offered by Canadian distributors were encoded with a classification system. The ratings system itself would not be developed and encoded into programming until March 2000. At the same time, private broadcasters and cable companies launched a website to provide information on the classification system, the V-chip and other related matters.\nThese initiatives - the V-chip, a classification system, industry codes and a public education initiative - remain in place on broadcast and cable TV today. All programs (excluding sports, news, talk shows and music videos) display an age-appropriate rating. Most Canadian-bought TVs are equipped with a V-chip (though less than 10 percent of households use it). The CBSC reviews and adjudicates complaints from the public and adherence to the voluntary industry codes remains a condition of CRTC licensing.\nThe rating of films and videos in Canada\nIn Canada, film and video classification is a provincial matter. The classification boards were established in the early 1900s as tools for film censorship but the responsibility has shifted over the years from censoring films to rating them.\nMost boards still retain the ability to censor and ban movies through their theatre legislation; few exercise this power except in the case of adult sex videos and even these cases are rare. Films coming from the U.S. have generally been self-censored already by producers to avoid the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) N-17 rating. It should be noted that these ratings are recommendations only and while individual movie houses or video stores may choose to enforce them, these ratings are not enforced by law. That said, the adoption of these ratings systems is so widespread that film ratings have heavy clout in determining the content of a film.\nWhen a film is released as a DVD, it is rated by the national Canadian Rating System for Home Videos. Ratings are produced by averaging the film classifications assigned by the seven provincial boards. All provinces, except Quebec and Ontario, now require the Canadian Home Video ratings stickers to be displayed on exterior casings of DVDs. Just as in the U.S., the system is voluntary, but video stores are encouraged to display posters explaining the classifications to customers. Under the Film Content Information Act 2020 in Ontario, \u201cno person shall sell, rent\u2026a physical copy of an adult sex film to a person who is under 18 years of age.\u201d [2]\nIn 2020, Ontario repealed the Film Classification Act of 2005. [3] The new law replacing it \u201celiminates film classification requirements and licensing requirements for film exhibitors.\u201d [4] Now, film exhibitors will provide information for the viewer on subjects such as appropriate viewing age, any violence, illicit substances or sexual content instead of the traditional age rating provided in the past. Past films with the previous age ratings system will be allowed to keep their rating and do not have to provide this new information.\nVideo Game Ratings\nVideo games have a ratings system similar to the one being used by the film industry. The Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB). Unlike the MPAA, the ESRB covers video game ratings in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The ESRB\u2019s rating system is further discussed on the ESRB\u2019s website which allows users to search games in order to see their ratings and read specific reasons for a given rating.\nThe Internet\nWith the increasing role the internet and networked technologies play in our lives, violent content can be accessed from almost anywhere. As user-generated content of all kinds continues to populate websites and file sharing communities, children are more likely than ever to encounter violence online.\nWhile television and films may display graphic representations of violence or gore, only in exceptional circumstances do we encounter images of actually performed acts of personal violence on television or in film. The internet, on the other hand, offers up much more access to images of real world violence and gore. Depending on the nature of such content they may be illegal or merely tasteless and offensive. Many web hosting services and websites have user agreements that prohibit certain kinds of offensive violent content as well so it is worthwhile to read the rules for a given site.\nAs a parent or teacher, it\u2019s important to address concerns about this kind of media violence with youth and children and to teach them how to respond to these types of encounters with online violence. More information on how to handle illegal and objectionable content such as materials that promote hate can be found in our Online Hate section.\nStreaming Services: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple+, etc.\nPopular streaming services such as Netflix, Crave and Apple+ fall outside of national or provincial jurisdiction and are not subject to the same film classification requirements as films or broadcast/cable TV. Nor have they yet adopted a self-regulatory structure such as the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Violence Code. Netflix, along with several other streaming services, provides a pop-up graphic on the screen that shows the content rating \u2013 though its ratings are self-applied. The director of enhanced content at Netflix commented on this addition in a blog post claiming, \u201cwe will\u2026begin displaying more prominently the maturity level rating for a series or film once a member hits play on a title\u2026we want to ensure members are fully aware of the maturity level as they begin watching.\u201d [5] While streaming services provide parents with much more control than traditional TV in terms of curating their children\u2019s screen experiences, they also keep inappropriate content just a few clicks away. Netflix, along with some other streamers, maintain separate children\u2019s sections, [6] but parents are still encouraged to supervise what their children are watching and, when possible, prepare playlists ahead of time.\nThe Future\nThe entertainment communications environment has changed considerably since the establishment of codes, ratings and filtering devices to protect children from unnecessary and excessive violence in the media. The convergence of media platforms and the availability of wireless (and hand-held) communications technologies are challenging former protection strategies such as \u201cwatershed hours\u201d and \u201cputting the TV in a well-trafficked area of the home.\u201d\nIn a globalized, increasingly unregulated world, the protection of children is going to rely increasingly on the vigilance of media-aware parents or guardians, public pressure from consumers and professional groups and the responsiveness of a responsible media sector.\n[1] (1993) Canadian Association of Broadcasters Violence Code.

{"question": "Should religion play a role in government policy?", "claim": "The opinion on this topic is divided, as evidenced by a 2019 AP-NORC poll which found that while a majority of Americans (64%) believe churches and other houses of worship should keep out of political matters, 36% say religious leaders should express their views on social and political questions.", "claim_raw_string": "The opinion on this topic is divided, as evidenced by a 2019 AP-NORC poll which found that while a majority of Americans (64%) believe churches and other houses of worship should keep out of political matters, 36% say religious leaders should express their views on social and political questions.", "response": "The opinion on this topic is divided, as evidenced by a 2019 AP-NORC poll which found that while a majority of Americans (64%) believe churches and other houses of worship should keep out of political matters, 36% say religious leaders should express their views on social and political questions. White evangelical Protestants were particularly likely to say religious leaders should express their views on social and political questions. That said, there is no consensus when it comes to the level of influence religion should have on government policies. Some believe that governments should protect and maintain religious freedom and foster the role of churches in society, while others believe religion should have no influence on government policy-making. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to decide for themselves whether or not they believe religion should play a role in government policy.", "references": ["Pew Research Center November 15, 2019\nA large majority of Americans feel that religion is losing influence in public life, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey. While some say this is a good thing, many more view it as a negative development, reflecting the broad tendency of Americans to see religion as a positive force in society.\nAt the same time, U.S. adults are resoundingly clear in their belief that religious institutions should stay out of politics. Nearly two-thirds of Americans in the new survey say churches and other houses of worship should keep out of political matters, while 36% say they should express their views on day-to-day social and political questions. And three-quarters of the public expresses the view that churches should not come out in favor of one candidate over another during elections, in contrast with efforts by President Trump to roll back existing legal limits on houses of worship endorsing candidates. 1\nIn addition, Americans are more likely to say that churches and other houses of worship currently have too much influence in politics (37%) rather than too little (28%), while the remaining one-third (34%) say religious groups\u2019 current level of influence on politics is about right.\nOn balance, U.S. adults have a favorable view about the role religious institutions play in American life more broadly \u2013 beyond politics. More than half of the public believes that churches and religious organizations do more good than harm in American society, while just one-in-five Americans say religious organizations do more harm than good. Likewise, there are far more U.S. adults who say that religious organizations strengthen morality in society and mostly bring people together than there are who say that religious organizations weaken morality and mostly push people apart. On all three of these questions, views have held steady since 2017 , the last time the Center measured opinions on these issues.\nThe survey also shows that roughly four-in-ten U.S. adults \u2013 including a majority of Christians \u2013 lament what they perceive as religion\u2019s declining influence on American society, while fewer than two-in-ten say they think religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a good thing. In addition, roughly two-thirds of the public believes that religious leaders in general have high or very high ethical standards, and a larger share of Americans who attend religious services at least a few times a year say this about the clergy in their own congregations. Among these U.S. adults who attend religious services, majorities express at least \u201csome\u201d confidence in their clergy to provide useful guidance not only on clearly religious topics (such as how to interpret scripture) but also on other matters, such as parenting and personal finance (see Chapter 2 ).\nThese are among the key findings from a nationally representative survey of 6,364 U.S. adults conducted online from March 18 to April 1, 2019, using Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel. The margin of sampling error for the full sample is plus or minus 1.7 percentage points. Many of the questions in the survey were asked only of U.S. adults who attend religious services a few times a year or more often; results for that group have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.\nThe survey, part of an ongoing effort by the Center to explore the role of trust, facts and democracy in American society, was designed to gauge the public\u2019s views about many aspects of religion\u2019s role in public life, as well as asking how much U.S. adults trust clergy to provide various kinds of guidance, what messages Americans receive from their clergy about other religious groups, how satisfied they are with the sermons they hear, how close they feel to their religious leaders, and whether they know \u2013 and share \u2013 the political views of the clergy in their houses of worship.\nThe survey shows that slightly more than half of U.S. adults say that the Republican Party is friendly toward religion (54%), while just under half say the same about the Trump administration (47%). Far fewer say these two groups are unfriendly toward religion. Other major societal institutions are viewed by majorities or pluralities of the public as neutral toward religion; for instance, roughly seven-in-ten U.S. adults say the Supreme Court is neutral toward religion.\nEqual shares say that reporters and the news media (54%) and university professors (54%) are neutral toward religion, and 48% say this about the Democratic Party. In each of these cases, however, Americans are considerably more likely to say these groups are unfriendly toward religion than to say they are friendly. For instance, more than one-third of the public (37%) says university professors are unfriendly to religion, while just 6% say professors are friendly to religion.\nOn balance, Republicans and Democrats mostly agree with each other that the GOP is friendly toward religion. They disagree, however, in their views about the Democratic Party; most Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party say the Democratic Party is unfriendly toward religion, while most Democrats and those who lean to the Democratic Party view their own party as neutral toward religion.\nThe survey also finds that four-in-ten U.S. adults (including six-in-ten among those who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party) think religious conservatives have too much control over the Republican Party. At the same time, one-third of Americans (including six-in-ten among those who identify with or lean toward the GOP) say liberals who are not religious have too much control over the Democratic Party.\nMore broadly, Republicans and Democrats express very different opinions about religion\u2019s impact on American public life. Seven-in-ten Republicans say churches and religious organizations do more good than harm in the U.S., and two-thirds say these institutions strengthen morality in American society and mostly bring people together (rather than push them apart). On all three of these measures, Democrats are less likely to share these positive views of religious organizations. 2\nFurthermore, most Republicans say religion either has about the right amount of influence (44%) or not enough influence (38%) in the political sphere, while a slim majority of Democrats say that religion has too much influence in politics (54%). And although most Republicans and Democrats (including those who lean toward each party) agree that religion is losing influence in American life, Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to view this as a regrettable development (63% vs. 27%). There are about as many Democrats who say religion\u2019s decline is a good thing (25%) as there are who say it is a bad thing (27%), with 22% of Democrats saying religion\u2019s declining influence doesn\u2019t make much difference either way.\nThere are stark racial differences among Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party in views on religion\u2019s role in society: Black Democrats consistently express more positive views of religious institutions than do white Democrats. For example, half or more of black Democrats say churches and religious organizations do more good than harm in American society, mostly bring people together (rather than push them apart), and strengthen morality in society. White Democrats are substantially less inclined than black Democrats to hold these views.\nIn addition, two-thirds of white Democrats say churches have too much political power, compared with only three-in-ten black Democrats and four-in-ten Hispanic Democrats who say this. In fact, black Democrats are just as likely as white Republicans to say churches do not have enough influence in politics (37% each). 3 And while one-third of white Democrats (33%) say that religion is losing influence in society more broadly and that this is a good thing, far fewer black (9%) and Hispanic (18%) Democrats agree.\nThe survey also sought to gauge people\u2019s perceptions about the politics of their clergy, finding that relatively few Americans say their clergy are united on one side of the partisan divide. In fact, many Americans who attend religious services at least a few times a year say they are unsure of the party affiliation of the clergy at their place of worship (45%), while about one-in-four say their clergy are a mix of both Republicans and Democrats (27%). 4 When those who attend religious services think they know their leaders\u2019 party affiliation, slightly more say their clergy are mostly Republicans (16%) than say they are mostly Democrats (11%).\nAmong partisans, few say their clergy are mostly members of the opposite party. For example, among those who attend religious services at least a few times a year and identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, just 4% say their clergy are mostly Democrats, while 23% say they are Republicans. Similarly, among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 8% say their clergy are Republicans, while 20% say their clergy are Democrats. Among both groups, most say they are unsure of the political leanings of their clergy, or say that there is a mix of both Republicans and Democrats in the religious leadership of their congregation.\nMost attenders \u2013 including majorities in both parties \u2013 are satisfied with the amount of political discussion they\u2019re hearing in sermons. About seven-in-ten say the sermons at their place of worship have about the right amount of political discussion, while 14% say there is not enough political talk and 11% say there is too much political talk in the sermons they hear.\nFurthermore, congregants tend to agree with their clergy when politics is discussed: Overall, about six-in-ten say they generally agree with their clergy about politics (62%), although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say this (70% vs. 56%).\nThe survey asked those who attend religious services at least a few times a year the extent to which religious leaders help inform their opinion about three social and political issues: abortion, immigration and global climate change. Four-in-ten religious service attenders have a lot of confidence in their clergy to provide useful guidance to inform their opinion on abortion. Smaller shares have a lot of trust in their clergy\u2019s guidance about immigration (20%) or global climate change (13%).\nRepublican attenders are much more likely than Democrats who go to religious services to say they have a lot of confidence in their clergy to provide guidance about abortion (53% vs. 25%). Catholics are consistently less likely than Protestants \u2013 particularly evangelical Protestants \u2013 to say they trust their clergy on all three issues. On abortion, for example, 34% of Catholics say they have a lot of trust in their clergy to provide guidance that helps form their opinion, compared with 46% of Protestants overall and 57% of evangelical Protestants who say this. Mainline Protestants (33%) and members of the historically black Protestant tradition (32%) look similar to Catholics on this question.\nOther key findings from the survey include:\n- Americans who attend religious services with any regularity express \u201ca lot\u201d of trust in the clergy or other religious leaders at their place of worship to provide advice about religious questions, such as growing closer to God or how to interpret scripture. They are more skeptical about advice from their religious leaders on other common life milestones and issues, such as marriage and relationships, parenting, mental health problems, and personal finances, although most express at least \u201csome\u201d confidence in their clergy to weigh in on these topics. And in general, Catholics are less likely than Protestants to say they trust their clergy to provide advice on these issues. (For more, see here .)\n- Most adults who attend religious services a few times a year or more describe themselves as having at least a \u201csomewhat close\u201d relationship with the clergy at their place of worship, although respondents are much more likely to say they have a \u201csomewhat close\u201d relationship with their clergy (50%) than a \u201cvery close\u201d one (19%). About three-in-ten say they are not close with the clergy at their congregation (29%). Just 8% of Catholics say they are very close with their clergy, a much lower share than in any other major U.S. Christian group analyzed. (For more, see here .)\n- Many U.S. adults hear messages about religious groups other than their own from their clergy or other religious leaders. About four-in-ten religious service attenders have heard their clergy speak out about atheists (43%), while slightly fewer have heard clergy speak out about Catholics or Jews (37% each). About one-third of attenders say they\u2019ve heard their clergy mention evangelical Christians (33%) or Muslims (31%). In terms of the types of messages congregants are hearing from their clergy, the messages about atheists tend to be more negative than positive, while the sentiments toward Jews are mostly positive. 5 (For more, see here .)\n- When searching for information about their religion\u2019s teachings, religiously affiliated adults say scripture is the most trusted source. Six-in-ten U.S. adults who identify with a religious group say they have \u201ca lot\u201d of confidence in the information they\u2019d find in scripture, and an additional three-in-ten say they have \u201csome\u201d confidence in this source. Four-in-ten would have a lot of confidence in the clergy at their congregation to give information about religious teachings. Fewer place a high level of trust in family, professors of religion, friends, religious leaders with a large national or international following, or information found online. (For more, see here .)\n- Most Americans (66%) say religious and nonreligious people generally are equally trustworthy, while fewer think religious people are more trustworthy than nonreligious people (21%) or that nonreligious people are the more trustworthy ones (12%). Majorities across religious groups say religious and nonreligious people are equally trustworthy, but evangelical Protestants are more likely than others to say religious people are especially trustworthy, and self-described atheists are particularly likely to put more trust in nonreligious people. (For more, see here .)\n- When U.S. adults find themselves in an argument about religion, most say they approach the conversation in a nonconfrontational manner. About six-in-ten say that when someone disagrees with them about religion, they try to understand the other person\u2019s point of view and agree to disagree. One-third say they simply avoid discussing religion when a disagreement arises, and only 4% say they try to change the other person\u2019s mind. (For more, see here .)\nThe remainder of this report examines the public\u2019s views about religion in public life and religious leaders in further detail, including differences in opinions across religious groups. Chapter 1 looks at Americans\u2019 views about religion in public life. Chapter 2 explores levels of confidence in clergy (and other clergy-related opinions) held by Americans who attend religious services at least a few times a year.

Often the past can prompt the question, \u201cHow could they have thought that?\u201d\nAnswers to that question are sought by Illinois State University Professor of History Amy Wood. She is a scholar of U.S. intellectual and cultural history, defined as the study of ideas\u2014both those of learned writers and thinkers as well as those of everyday people.\nAppears In\nCultural beliefs and values are historical, noted Wood, who describes her work as examining the history of beliefs, values, and emotions in the 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cBeliefs change over time, often underpinning larger social or political events,\u201d said Wood. \u201cEven feelings, which we consider personal and subjective, are social in nature and are likewise historically driven.\u201d\nIt is the dark nature of those shifting beliefs that intrigues Wood\u2014in particular, how abhorrent or bizarre practices come to be socially acceptable. From lynching rituals to \u201cmad-elephant\u201d executions, Wood examines how watching spectacles of death and violence became normalized, or how hardened criminals became the object of public sympathy. Looking to popular culture such as photography, film, and literature, Wood seeks to uncover how public sentiment was both represented and shaped in the past.\nWood\u2019s 2009 book, Lynching and Spectacle: Witnessing Racial Violence in America, 1890\u20131940 , won the Lillian Smith Book Award, was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in history, and was named a Choice Outstanding Academic Book by the American Library Association. She has also edited the violence volume of the New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture and has co-edited a special issue of Mississippi Quarterly titled \u201cLynching and American Culture,\u201d in addition to numerous journal articles, book chapters, and book reviews. She won the College of Arts and Sciences Excellence Award for Outstanding Scholarship in 2010 and Outstanding Researcher Award in 2015.\nWood\u2019s desire to comprehend the motivations behind social violence in the post-Civil War United States stems from a curiosity and temperament she describes simply. \u201cI can tend to be pretty dark.\u201d\n\u201cI became interested in studying the dark roots of my own culture.\u201d\u2014Amy Wood\nShe was drawn to the topic of racial violence during her time as a master\u2019s student at the University of Mississippi when, as a research assistant for an Alabama Public Television documentary on violence in the South, she stumbled across a series of photographs and postcards of actual lynchings in an archive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrific. It\u2019s atrocious, and\u2014from our perspective\u2014so bizarre,\u201d said Wood of the practice of taking photos of black lynching victims in the Jim Crow South and selling them as postcards. Amateur photographers took some of the photos; others were taken by professionals whose function was to commemorate community events. \u201cWhen they sold these out of their studios, it became a money-making, commercial venture for them.\u201d\nWhat struck Wood was the question of why. \u201cWho took these? Why would anyone take these? What did they mean to people? How did they use them?\u201d she asked. She took up these questions in her first book, Lynching and Spectacle . Wood examined the taking and distribution of photographs as a crucial aspect of the larger lynching ritual that legitimized white supremacy in the Jim Crow south. She also analyzed lynching rituals as they intersected with other cultural practices, such as religious rites, public executions, and motion pictures, practices that further helped to justify the violence.\nAs the postcards and other public images of lynching began moving out of the Southern communities, Wood said they ignited the opposite effect, sparking outrage outside the culture of the Jim Crow South. \u201cThese images were taken up by anti-lynching activists,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the spectacle of lynching actually worked to undo the practice of lynching.\u201d\nIt was never Wood\u2019s intention to study history. She grew up the youngest of three children in Providence, Rhode Island. Her father was a professor of history at Brown University. \u201cI was a rebellious child and thought I would never be like my father,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe fact that I teach history now is an irony not lost on me or the rest of my family.\u201d\nWood majored in European literature and philosophy at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, but was drawn to American literature during her study abroad semester in Heidelberg, Germany. \u201cIn studying German culture, I became interested in studying the dark roots of my own culture,\u201d she said.\nReturning to the U.S., she wrote her senior honors thesis on female rebellion in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne and William Faulkner. After college, while working in a bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she continued her interest in Southern literature. \u201cI started a Faulkner reading group with a friend. I became a bit obsessed about understanding the South, everything about Faulkner\u2019s world,\u201d Wood said. She finally responded to a longing only youth can fulfill. \u201cOn a whim, I quit my job, sold all my furniture, and moved to Oxford, Mississippi, without a job or a place to live, and without knowing a soul there.\u201d She smiled at her impulsive uprooting from the Northeast to Faulkner\u2019s hometown. Finding a job at a local bookstore, Wood later enrolled in the Southern studies program at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, with the intent to focus on literature.\nThe only Northerner in her graduate class, Wood initially found it hard to fit in, but eventually found her footing and her mentors. She was unexpectedly drawn to history classes, spurred by a desire to understand literature and other forms of culture as products of historical milieu. \u201cTwo of my advisors were both historians and had a huge influence on me,\u201d Wood said of now Professor Emeritus Charles Wilson and Center for the Study of Southern Culture Director Ted Ownby. \u201cThey encouraged me to go for my Ph.D. Those two turned me into a historian.\u201d\nWood continued her study of Southern history and culture at Emory University, where she earned a Ph.D. in American studies in 2003, and worked for several years at the Southern Regional Council, an Atlanta-based civil rights organization. After receiving her doctorate, she arrived at Illinois State University, where she teaches courses in U.S. cultural and intellectual history and Southern history.\nHer wit and interdisciplinary approach to history are known to draw in students, and they often challenge her to guess how future generations would view the culture of our time. \u201cMy students ask me how people will think about us in 100 years,\u201d said Wood. She instructs students to picture walking into a classroom 50 years ago where all the men wore ties and jackets, and the women sported skirts and dresses. \u201cWhat does that tell us about what they valued? Or what did they think about education? And what does it tell us about how as a society, we thought of students?\u201d Wood referred to the students\u2019 responses as \u201clively.\u201d She earned the College of Arts and Sciences Outstanding Teaching Award in 2018.\nAfter publishing her award-winning book on lynching and spectacle in 2009, Wood has spent the past decade producing a slew of book chapters, articles, and presentations on the South, white supremacy, lynching melodramas, racial violence, public executions, and vengeance. That work includes her article \u201cKilling the Elephant: Murderous Beasts and the Thrill of Retribution, 1885\u20131930.\u201d Appearing in the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era , the piece was honored as best article from 2012 and 2013 from the society that published the journal.\nWhile researching her first book, Wood came across photos and even early films of circus elephants that were executed\u2014by hanging, electrocution, or firing squad\u2014after hurting or killing a human. \u201cIn the antebellum period, if elephants went on a rampage, they would just shoot them,\u201d said Wood. \u201cBut after the Civil War, they began executing them as public spectacles, replicating criminal executions.\u201d Circuses would sell tickets to the executions, and local newspapers would cover the events, describing the pachyderms with the characteristics of a human criminal. \u201cThere was one case in Madison Square Garden where they lined up the other circus elephants to watch the execution as a deterrent,\u201d said Wood.\nIn the article, she placed these strange events in the context of popular understandings of the criminal and retribution as a form of justice. Ideas about criminality and punishment were changing in the late 19th century, and the elephant became a convenient stand-in for the criminal. \u201cThey were seen as savage and animalistic,\u201d said Wood, \u201cbut, at the same time, they became objects of sympathy, as creatures who could not control impulses we all have.\u201d\nWood\u2019s interest in the history of criminal justice continues with her most recent book, Crime and Punishment in the Jim Crow South , an edited collection that provides case studies of the role criminal justice played as a tool of racial oppression in the Southern United States in the late 19th and 20th centuries.\n\u201cThe majority of prisoners in the postbellum South were African American, up to 90 percent in the 1880s and 1890s,\u201d she said. \u201cGenerally, white crime was overlooked. Black people were over-policed, more likely to be imprisoned, and given longer prison sentences.\u201d\nWood included a chapter of her own on South Carolina Gov. Cole Blease\u2019s prison reform efforts, noting how he used the language of reforms as a way to resist the modern bureaucratic state and bolster his own authoritarian power. Although he adopted the humanitarian rhetoric and some goals of national prison reform, he rejected the state infrastructure that would have allowed for reform. \u201cBlease\u2019s tenure shows the distinct ways that prison reform operated in the South,\u201d said Wood. \u201cInstead of setting up bureaucracies to create oversight on the state prison, Cole Blease does two things. He sends prisoners off to the counties to work on brutal chain gangs or he pardons them. In other words, he empties out the state penitentiary.\u201d\nFor her next book project, Wood vowed not to write about violence. Instead, she wants to write a history of emotions to explore how compassion and sympathy operated as social and political principles in the Progressive Era in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She plans to do this by looking at \u2026 criminology and prison reform. \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t get away from it,\u201d she said about studying the dark nature of humanity. The book will be called Sympathy for the Devil: The Criminal in the American Imagination , and will include work from her Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship to study the papers of Jack London at the Huntington Library. \u201cFor a chapter of the book, I\u2019m looking at representations of criminality in literary naturalism, which was a kind of literary movement that included writers like Jack London, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris,\u201d she said.\nLondon, an advocate of prison reform, was a Darwinist, interested in the innate impulses that drive people to crime, and a socialist who saw the roots of crime in unjust social environments. \u201cYou can see his ideas about crime and punishment in works like White Fang ,\u201d said Wood. \u201cIt follows popular narratives at the time about criminals, their degradation and then\ntheir redemption through the sympathy of others.\u201d\nThough Wood\u2019s studies delve into the dark side of U.S. history, she often looks at the opposite\u2014ideas of reform and redemption. Wood\u2019s work provides a reminder that even as the nation walks through the darkest tunnel, there is a way toward the light."], "citation_links": ["https://news.illinoisstate.edu/2019/10/when-the-abhorrent-becomes-normal-examining-shifting-beliefs-and-values-through-cultural-history/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_2c2efdf9-242d-4837-8b60-039f4e4c3ccf"}

David Driscoll prepared the text for this pamphlet.\nTax Policy for Developing Countries\nWhy do we have taxes? The simple answer is that, until someone comes up with a better idea, taxation is the only practical means of raising the revenue to finance government spending on the goods and services that most of us demand. Setting up an efficient and fair tax system is, however, far from simple, particularly for developing countries that want to become integrated in the international economy. The ideal tax system in these countries should raise essential revenue without excessive government borrowing, and should do so without discouraging economic activity and without deviating too much from tax systems in other countries.\nDeveloping countries face formidable challenges when they attempt to establish efficient tax systems. First, most workers in these countries are typically employed in agriculture or in small, informal enterprises. As they are seldom paid a regular, fixed wage, their earnings fluctuate, and many are paid in cash, \"off the books.\" The base for an income tax is therefore hard to calculate. Nor do workers in these countries typically spend their earnings in large stores that keep accurate records of sales and inventories. As a result, modern means of raising revenue, such as income taxes and consumer taxes, play a diminished role in these economies, and the possibility that the government will achieve high tax levels is virtually excluded.\nSecond, it is difficult to create an efficient tax administration without a well-educated and well-trained staff, when money is lacking to pay good wages to tax officials and to computerize the operation (or even to provide efficient telephone and mail services), and when taxpayers have limited ability to keep accounts. As a result, governments often take the path of least resistance, developing tax systems that allow them to exploit whatever options are available rather than establishing rational, modern, and efficient tax systems.\nThird, because of the informal structure of the economy in many developing countries and because of financial limitations, statistical and tax offices have difficulty in generating reliable statistics. This lack of data prevents policymakers from assessing the potential impact of major changes to the tax system. As a result, marginal changes are often preferred over major structural changes, even when the latter are clearly preferable. This perpetuates inefficient tax structures.\nFourth, income tends to be unevenly distributed within developing countries. Although raising high tax revenues in this situation ideally calls for the rich to be taxed more heavily than the poor, the economic and political power of rich taxpayers often allows them to prevent fiscal reforms that would increase their tax burdens. This explains in part why many developing countries have not fully exploited personal income and property taxes and why their tax systems rarely achieve satisfactory progressivity (in other words, where the rich pay proportionately more taxes).\nIn conclusion, in developing countries, tax policy is often the art of the possible rather than the pursuit of the optimal. It is therefore not surprising that economic theory and especially optimal taxation literature have had relatively little impact on the design of tax systems in these countries. In discussing tax policy issues facing many developing countries today, the authors of this pamphlet consequently draw on extensive practical, first-hand experience with the IMF's provision of tax policy advice to those countries. They consider these issues from both the macroeconomic (the level and composition of tax revenue) and microeconomic (design aspects of specific taxes) perspective.\nLevel of Tax Revenue\nWhat level of public spending is desirable for a developing country at a given level of national income? Should the government spend one-tenth of national income? A third? Half? Only when this question has been answered can the next question be addressed of where to set the ideal level of tax revenue; determining the optimal tax level is conceptually equivalent to determining the optimal level of government spending. Unfortunately, the vast literature on optimal tax theory provides little practical guidance on how to integrate the optimal level of tax revenue with the optimal level of government expenditure.\nNevertheless, an alternative, statistically based approach to assessing whether the overall tax level in a developing country is appropriate consists of comparing the tax level in a specific country to the average tax burden of a representative group of both developing and industrial countries, taking into account some of these countries' similarities and dissimilarities. This comparison indicates only whether the country's tax level, relative to other countries and taking into account various characteristics, is above or below the average. This statistical approach has no theoretical basis and does not indicate the \"optimal\" tax level for any country. The most recent data show that the tax level in major industrialized countries (members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or OECD) is about double the tax level in a representative sample of developing countries (38 percent of GDP compared with 18 percent).\nEconomic development will often generate additional needs for tax revenue to finance a rise in public spending, but at the same time it increases the countries' ability to raise revenue to meet these needs. More important than the level of taxation per se is how revenue is used. Given the complexity of the development process, it is doubtful that the concept of an optimal level of taxation robustly linked to different stages of economic development could ever be meaningfully derived for any country.\nComposition of Tax Revenue\nTurning to the composition of tax revenue, we find ourselves in an area of conflicting theories. The issues involve the taxation of income relative to that of consumption and under consumption, the taxation of imports versus the taxation of domestic consumption. Both efficiency (whether the tax enhances or diminishes the overall welfare of those who are taxed) and equity (whether the tax is fair to everybody) are central to the analysis.\nThe conventional belief that taxing income entails a higher welfare (efficiency) cost than taxing consumption is based in part on the fact that income tax, which contains elements of both a labor tax and a capital tax, reduces the taxpayer's ability to save. Doubt has been cast on this belief, however, by considerations of the crucial role of the length of the taxpayer's planning horizon and the cost of human and physical capital accumulation. The upshot of these theoretical considerations renders the relative welfare costs of the two taxes (income and consumption) uncertain.\nAnother concern in the choice between taxing income and taxing consumption involves their relative impact on equity. Taxing consumption has traditionally been thought to be inherently more regressive (that is, harder on the poor than the rich) than taxing income. Doubt has been cast on this belief as well. Theoretical and practical considerations suggest that the equity concerns about the traditional form of taxing consumption are probably overstated and that, for developing countries, attempts to address these concerns by such initiatives as graduated consumption taxes would be ineffective and administratively impractical.\nWith regard to taxes on imports, lowering these taxes will lead to more competition from foreign enterprises. While reducing protection of domestic industries from this foreign competition is an inevitable consequence, or even the objective, of a trade liberalization program, reduced budgetary revenue would be an unwelcome by-product of the program. Feasible compensatory revenue measures under the circumstances almost always involve increasing domestic consumption taxes. Rarely would increasing income taxes be considered a viable option on the grounds of both policy (because of their perceived negative impact on investment) and administration (because their revenue yield is less certain and less timely than that from consumption tax changes).\nData from industrial and developing countries show that the ratio of income to consumption taxes in industrial countries has consistently remained more than double the ratio in developing countries. (That is, compared with developing countries, industrial countries derive proportionally twice as much revenue from income tax than from consumption tax.) The data also reveal a notable difference in the ratio of corporate income tax to personal income tax. Industrial countries raise about four times as much from personal income tax than from corporate income tax. Differences between the two country groups in wage income, in the sophistication of the tax administration, and in the political power of the richest segment of the population are the primary contributors to this disparity. On the other hand, revenue from trade taxes is significantly higher in developing countries than in industrial countries.\nWhile it is difficult to draw clear-cut normative policy prescriptions from international comparisons as regards the income-consumption tax mix, a compelling implication revealed by the comparison is that economic development tends to lead to a relative shift in the composition of revenue from consumption to personal income taxes. At any given point of time, however, the important tax policy issue for developing countries is not so much to determine the optimal tax mix as to spell out clearly the objectives to be achieved by any contemplated shift in the mix, to assess the economic consequences (for efficiency and equity) of such a shift, and to implement compensatory measures if the poor are made worse off by the shift.\nSelecting the Right Tax System\nIn developing countries where market forces are increasingly important in allocating resources, the design of the tax system should be as neutral as possible so as to minimize interference in the allocation process. The system should also have simple and transparent administrative procedures so that it is clear if the system is not being enforced as designed.\nPersonal Income Tax\nAny discussion of personal income tax in developing countries must start with the observation that this tax has yielded relatively little revenue in most of these countries and that the number of individuals subject to this tax (especially at the highest marginal rate) is small. The rate structure of the personal income tax is the most visible policy instrument available to most governments in developing countries to underscore their commitment to social justice and hence to gain political support for their policies. Countries frequently attach great importance to maintaining some degree of nominal progressivity in this tax by applying many rate brackets, and they are reluctant to adopt reforms that will reduce the number of these brackets.\nMore often than not, however, the effectiveness of rate progressivity is severely undercut by high personal exemptions and the plethora of other exemptions and deductions that benefit those with high incomes (for example, the exemption of capital gains from tax, generous deductions for medical and educational expenses, the low taxation of financial income). Tax relief through deductions is particularly egregious because these deductions typically increase in the higher tax brackets. Experience compellingly suggests that effective rate progressivity could be improved by reducing the degree of nominal rate progressivity and the number of brackets and reducing exemptions and deductions. Indeed, any reasonable equity objective would require no more than a few nominal rate brackets in the personal income tax structure. If political constraints prevent a meaningful restructuring of rates, a substantial improvement in equity could still be achieved by replacing deductions with tax credits, which could deliver the same benefits to taxpayers in all tax brackets.\nThe effectiveness of a high marginal tax rate is also much reduced by its often being applied at such high levels of income (expressed in shares of per capita GDP) that little income is subject to these rates. In some developing countries, a taxpayer's income must be hundreds of times the per capita income before it enters the highest rate bracket.\nMoreover, in some countries the top marginal personal income tax rate exceeds the corporate income tax by a significant margin, providing strong incentives for taxpayers to choose the corporate form of doing business for purely tax reasons. Professionals and small entrepreneurs can easily siphon off profits through expense deductions over time and escape the highest personal income tax permanently. A tax delayed is a tax evaded. Good tax policy, therefore, ensures that the top marginal personal income tax rate does not differ materially from the corporate income tax rate.\nIn addition to the problem of exemptions and deductions tending to narrow the tax base and to negate effective progressivity, the personal income tax structure in many developing countries is riddled with serious violations of the two basic principles of good tax policy: symmetry and inclusiveness. (It goes without saying, of course, that tax policy should also be guided by the general principles of neutrality, equity, and simplicity.) The symmetry principle refers to the identical treatment for tax purposes of gains and losses of any given source of income. If the gains are taxable, then the losses should be deductible. The inclusiveness principle relates to capturing an income stream in the tax net at some point along the path of that stream. For example, if a payment is exempt from tax for a payee, then it should not be a deductible expense for the payer. Violating these principles generally leads to distortions and inequities.\nThe tax treatment of financial income is problematic in all countries. Two issues dealing with the taxation of interest and dividends in developing countries are relevant:\n- In many developing countries, interest income, if taxed at all, is taxed as a final withholding tax at a rate substantially below both the top marginal personal and corporate income tax rate. For taxpayers with mainly wage income, this is an acceptable compromise between theoretical correctness and practical feasibility. For those with business income, however, the low tax rate on interest income coupled with full deductibility of interest expenditure implies that significant tax savings could be realized through fairly straightforward arbitrage transactions. Hence it is important to target carefully the application of final withholding on interest income: final withholding should not be applied if the taxpayer has business income.\n- The tax treatment of dividends raises the well-known double taxation issue. For administrative simplicity, most developing countries would be well advised either to exempt dividends from the personal income tax altogether, or to tax them at a relatively low rate, perhaps through a final withholding tax at the same rate as that imposed on interest income.\nCorporate Income Tax\nTax policy issues relating to corporate income tax are numerous and complex, but particularly relevant for developing countries are the issues of multiple rates based on sectoral differentiation and the incoherent design of the depreciation system. Developing countries are more prone to having multiple rates along sectoral lines (including the complete exemption from tax of certain sectors, especially the parastatal sector) than industrial countries, possibly as a legacy of past economic regimes that emphasized the state's role in resource allocation. Such practices, however, are clearly detrimental to the proper functioning of market forces (that is, the sectoral allocation of resources is distorted by differences in tax rates). They are indefensible if a government's commitment to a market economy is real. Unifying multiple corporate income tax rates should thus be a priority.\nAllowable depreciation of physical assets for tax purposes is an important structural element in determining the cost of capital and the profitability of investment. The most common shortcomings found in the depreciation systems in developing countries include too many asset categories and depreciation rates, excessively low depreciation rates, and a structure of depreciation rates that is not in accordance with the relative obsolescence rates of different asset categories. Rectifying these shortcomings should also receive a high priority in tax policy deliberations in these countries.\nIn restructuring their depreciation systems, developing countries could well benefit from certain guidelines:\n- Classifying assets into three or four categories should be more than sufficient\u2014for example, grouping assets that last a long time, such as buildings, at one end, and fast-depreciating assets, such as computers, at the other with one or two categories of machinery and equipment in between.\n- Only one depreciation rate should be assigned to each category.\n- Depreciation rates should generally be set higher than the actual physical lives of the underlying assets to compensate for the lack of a comprehensive inflation-compensating mechanism in most tax systems.\n- On administrative grounds, the declining-balance method should be preferred to the straight-line method. The declining-balance method allows the pooling of all assets in the same asset category and automatically accounts for capital gains and losses from asset disposals, thus substantially simplifying bookkeeping requirements.\nValue-Added Tax, Excises, and Import Tariffs\nWhile VAT has been adopted in most developing countries, it frequently suffers from being incomplete in one aspect or another. Many important sectors, most notably services and the wholesale and retail sector, have been left out of the VAT net, or the credit mechanism is excessively restrictive (that is, there are denials or delays in providing proper credits for VAT on inputs), especially when it comes to capital goods. As these features allow a substantial degree of cascading (increasing the tax burden for the final user), they reduce the benefits from introducing the VAT in the first place. Rectifying such limitations in the VAT design and administration should be given priority in developing countries.\nMany developing countries (like many OECD countries) have adopted two or more VAT rates. Multiple rates are politically attractive because they ostensibly\u2014though not necessarily effectively\u2014serve an equity objective, but the administrative price for addressing equity concerns through multiple VAT rates may be higher in developing than in industrial countries. The cost of a multiple-rate system should be carefully scrutinized.\nThe most notable shortcoming of the excise systems found in many developing countries is their inappropriately broad coverage of\nproducts\u2014often for revenue reasons. As is well known, the economic rationale for imposing excises is very different from that for imposing a general consumption tax. While the latter should be broadly based to maximize revenue with minimum distortion, the former should be highly selective, narrowly targeting a few goods mainly on the grounds that their consumption entails negative externalities on society (in other words, society at large pays a price for their use by individuals). The goods typically deemed to be excisable (tobacco, alcohol, petroleum products, and motor vehicles, for example) are few and usually inelastic in demand. A good excise system is invariably one that generates revenue (as a by-product) from a narrow base and with relatively low administrative costs.\nReducing import tariffs as part of an overall program of trade liberalization is a major policy challenge currently facing many developing countries. Two concerns should be carefully addressed. First, tariff reduction should not lead to unintended changes in the relative rates of effective protection across sectors. One simple way of ensuring that unintended consequences do not occur would be to reduce all nominal tariff rates by the same proportion whenever such rates need to be changed. Second, nominal tariff reductions are likely to entail short-term revenue loss. This loss can be avoided through a clear-cut strategy in which separate compensatory measures are considered in sequence: first reducing the scope of tariff exemptions in the existing system, then compensating for the tariff reductions on excisable imports by a commensurate increase in their excise rates, and finally adjusting the rate of the general consumption tax (such as the VAT) to meet remaining revenue needs.\nTax Incentives\nWhile granting tax incentives to promote investment is common in countries around the world, evidence suggests that their effectiveness in attracting incremental investments\u2014above and beyond the level that would have been reached had no incentives been granted\u2014is often questionable. As tax incentives can be abused by existing enterprises disguised as new ones through nominal reorganization, their revenue costs can be high. Moreover, foreign investors, the primary target of most tax incentives, base their decision to enter a country on a whole host of factors (such as natural resources, political stability, transparent regulatory systems, infrastructure, a skilled workforce), of which tax incentives are frequently far from being the most important one. Tax incentives could also be of questionable value to a foreign investor because the true beneficiary of the incentives may not be the investor, but rather the treasury of his home country. This can come about when any income spared from taxation in the host country is taxed by the investor's home country.\nTax incentives can be justified if they address some form of market failure, most notably those involving externalities (economic consequences beyond the specific beneficiary of the tax incentive). For example, incentives targeted to promote high-technology industries that promise to confer significant positive externalities on the rest of the economy are usually legitimate. By far the most compelling case for granting targeted incentives is for meeting regional development needs of these countries. Nevertheless, not all incentives are equally suited for achieving such objectives and some are less cost-effective than others. Unfortunately, the most prevalent forms of incentives found in developing countries tend to be the least meritorious.\nTax Holidays\nOf all the forms of tax incentives, tax holidays (exemptions from paying tax for a certain period of time) are the most popular among developing countries. Though simple to administer, they have numerous shortcomings. First, by exempting profits irrespective of their amount, tax holidays tend to benefit an investor who expects high profits and would have made the investment even if this incentive were not offered. Second, tax holidays provide a strong incentive for tax avoidance, as taxed enterprises can enter into economic relationships with exempt ones to shift their profits through transfer pricing (for example, overpaying for goods from the other enterprise and receiving a kickback). Third, the duration of the tax holiday is prone to abuse and extension by investors through creative redesignation of existing investment as new investment (for example, closing down and restarting the same project under a different name but with the same ownership). Fourth, time-bound tax holidays tend to attract short-run projects, which are typically not so beneficial to the economy as longer-term ones. Fifth, the revenue cost of the tax holiday to the budget is seldom transparent, unless enterprises enjoying the holiday are required to file tax forms. In this case, the government must spend resources on tax administration that yields no revenue and the enterprise loses the advantage of not having to deal with tax authorities.\nTax Credits and Investment Allowances\nCompared with tax holidays, tax credits and investment allowances have a number of advantages. They are much better targeted than tax holidays for promoting particular types of investment and their revenue cost is much more transparent and easier to control. A simple and effective way of administering a tax credit system is to determine the amount of the credit to a qualified enterprise and to \"deposit\" this amount into a special tax account in the form of a bookkeeping entry. In all other respects the enterprise will be treated like an ordinary taxpayer, subject to all applicable tax regulations, including the obligation to file tax returns. The only difference would be that its income tax liabilities would be paid from credits \"withdrawn\" from its tax account. In this way information is always available on the budget revenue forgone and on the amount of tax credits still available to the enterprise. A system of investment allowances could be administered in much the same way as tax credits, achieving similar results.\nThere are two notable weaknesses associated with tax credits and investment allowances. First, these incentives tend to distort choice in favor of short-lived capital assets since further credit or allowance becomes available each time an asset is replaced. Second, qualified enterprises may attempt to abuse the system by selling and purchasing the same assets to claim multiple credits or allowances or by acting as a purchasing agent for enterprises not qualified to receive the incentive. Safeguards must be built into the system to minimize these dangers.\nAccelerated Depreciation\nProviding tax incentives in the form of accelerated depreciation has the least of the shortcomings associated with tax holidays and all of the virtues of tax credits and investment allowances\u2014and overcomes the latter's weakness to boot. Since merely accelerating the depreciation of an asset does not increase the depreciation of the asset beyond its original cost, little distortion in favor of short-term assets is generated. Moreover, accelerated depreciation has two additional merits. First, it is generally least costly, as the forgone revenue (relative to no acceleration) in the early years is at least partially recovered in subsequent years of the asset's life. Second, if the acceleration is made available only temporarily, it could induce a significant short-run surge in investment.\nInvestment Subsidies\nWhile investment subsidies (providing public funds for private investments) have the advantage of easy targeting, they are generally quite problematic. They involve out-of-pocket expenditure by the government up front and they benefit nonviable investments as much as profitable ones. Hence, the use of investment subsidies is seldom advisable.\nIndirect Tax Incentives\nIndirect tax incentives, such as exempting raw materials and capital goods from the VAT, are prone to abuse and are of doubtful utility. Exempting from import tariffs raw materials and capital goods used to produce exports is somewhat more justifiable. The difficulty with this exemption lies, of course, in ensuring that the exempted purchases will in fact be used as intended by the incentive. Establishing export production zones whose perimeters are secured by customs controls is a useful, though not entirely foolproof, remedy for this abuse.\nTriggering Mechanisms\nThe mechanism by which tax incentives can be triggered can be either automatic or discretionary. An automatic triggering mechanism allows the investment to receive the incentives automatically once it satisfies clearly specified objective qualifying criteria, such as a minimum amount of investment in certain sectors of the economy. The relevant authorities have merely to ensure that the qualifying criteria are met. A discretionary triggering mechanism involves approving or denying an application for incentives on the basis of subjective value judgment by the incentive-granting authorities, without formally stated qualifying criteria. A discretionary triggering mechanism may be seen by the authorities as preferable to an automatic one because it provides them with more flexibility. This advantage is likely to be outweighed, however, by a variety of problems associated with discretion, most notably a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which could in turn encourage corruption and rent-seeking activities. If the concern about having an automatic triggering mechanism is the loss of discretion in handling exceptional cases, the preferred safeguard would be to formulate the qualifying criteria in as narrow and specific a fashion as possible, so that incentives are granted only to investments meeting the highest objective and quantifiable standard of merit. On balance, it is advisable to minimize the discretionary element in the incentive-granting process.\nSumming Up\nThe cost-effectiveness of providing tax incentives to promote investment is generally questionable. The best strategy for sustained investment promotion is to provide a stable and transparent legal and regulatory framework and to put in place a tax system in line with international norms. Some objectives, such as those that encourage regional development, are more justifiable than others as a basis for granting tax incentives. Not all tax incentives are equally effective. Accelerated depreciation has the most comparative merits, followed by investment allowances or tax credits. Tax holidays and investment subsidies are among the least meritorious. As a general rule, indirect tax incentives should be avoided, and discretion in granting incentives should be minimized.\nTax Policy Challenges Facing Developing Countries\nDeveloping countries attempting to become fully integrated in the world economy will probably need a higher tax level if they are to pursue a government role closer to that of industrial countries, which, on average, enjoy twice the tax revenue. Developing countries will need to reduce sharply their reliance on foreign trade taxes, without at the same time creating economic disincentives, especially in raising more revenue from personal income tax. To meet these challenges, policymakers in these countries will have to get their policy priorities right and have the political will to implement the necessary reforms. Tax administrations must be strengthened to accompany the needed policy changes.\nAs trade barriers come down and capital becomes more mobile, the formulation of sound tax policy poses significant challenges for developing countries. The need to replace foreign trade taxes with domestic taxes will be accompanied by growing concerns about profit diversion by foreign investors, which weak provisions against tax abuse in the tax laws as well as inadequate technical training of tax auditors in many developing countries are currently unable to deter. A concerted effort to eliminate these deficiencies is therefore of the utmost urgency.\nTax competition is another policy challenge in a world of liberalized capital movement. The effectiveness of tax incentives\u2014in the absence of other necessary fundamentals\u2014is highly questionable. A tax system that is riddled with such incentives will inevitably provide fertile grounds for rent-seeking activities. To allow their emerging markets to take proper root, developing countries would be well advised to refrain from reliance on poorly targeted tax incentives as the main vehicle for investment promotion.\nFinally, personal income taxes have been contributing very little to total tax revenue in many developing countries. Apart from structural, policy, and administrative considerations, the ease with which income received by individuals can be invested abroad significantly contributes to this outcome. Taxing this income is therefore a daunting challenge for developing countries. This has been particularly problematic in several Latin American countries that have largely stopped taxing financial income to encourage financial capital to remain in the country.\nAuthor Information\nVito Tanzi was the Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF from 1981 to 2000.

The idea of human rights spread quickly from Babylon to Greece and eventually Rome, where the concept of \"natural law\" arose. There are also philosophical debates about whether or not the ancient Greeks had a concept of human rights.", "references": ["Three years ago in Paris, during festivities to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, a prominent British visitor cast doubt on the proceedings by asserting that the concept of human rights is not a new thing we owe to the makers of the French Revolution: it goes back to the ancient Greeks.\nA diplomatic crisis ensued. Important questions of national identity were at stake. Background became foreground and our relation to Classical antiquity was suddenly the focus of political debate. Who was right, the Prime Minister of Great Britain or the President of France?\nWell, as often happens with important questions, there are things to say on either side \u2013 a good deal more than was said at the time when Mrs Thatcher intervened, like the Scarlet Pimpernel, to sabotage the revolutionary festivities. It is easy to say that the ancient Greeks laid the foundations of Western civilisation. It is not a simple matter to discover, in detail, how much of what we now are is owed to them.\nThere are three terms to be clear about:\nWhat is a right?\nWhat is a human right?\nAnd (3) what is it to have the concept of human rights?\nA serious answer to the question \u2018Do we owe the concept of human rights to the ancient Greeks?\u2019 must take a stand on each of these three difficult and controversial issues.\nWhat, first, is a right? One influential answer, formulated by the American jurist Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld in 1913, is that you have a right to possess or do something if and only if other people have a duty not to interfere with your possession or doing of it. Let us take as an example your right to travel abroad. There is more to this than the fact that nothing prohibits you from travelling if you wish. You would have the liberty \u2013 in Hohfeld's vocabulary a privilege \u2013 of travelling abroad, but not a right to travel, if nothing prohibited you from going and nothing prohibited other people from trying to stop you. It is only when other people are so prohibited that your liberty to travel becomes a right. A right is a protected liberty.\nHohfeld's thesis that rights correspond to duties on other people not to interfere is surely not the last word on what a right is. But it is widely accepted as the first word, a good starting point for inquiry. If we want to find rights in the ancient world, the least we must look for is this: liberties which are protected by prohibitions on other people.\nThere is no doubt that such rights can be found. Even for slaves there was legislation which determined what slaves and masters were permitted to do to each other. Roughly, a master could inflict any mistreatment he liked, short of killing the slave. The slave had only the right to seek asylum and ask to be sold to someone else. But it was an offence to punish a slave for doing this. The liberties on each side are unequal, but both are protected by the law. They are legal rights. More obvious and familiar examples would be property rights and the rights associated with citizenship at Athens or Sparta.\nTo turn from legal rights to human rights is to change the terms of the question in two respects. First, the liberties we are looking for must belong to all humans. Why they belong to all humans is a further question. Perhaps they belong to all humans because they are human; perhaps it is because of some characteristic of humanity that other creatures might share as well, e.g., because they are rational. That is a complication we can leave until later.\nThe second change has to do with the protection for the liberties, the source of the prohibition on other people not to interfere. Instead of Athenian or Spartan legislation, rights that belong to all humans should be grounded in divine law, the moral law, or natural law \u2013 some source of imperatives that is prior and superior to the ordinary laws of this society or that. Whether we use the language of natural rights or the now fashionable language of human rights, the basic idea is that they are rights which people possess prior to, and independently of, any civil order. Such rights are supposed to set constraints on admissible legislation. They derive from standards by which ordinary laws can be judged and found wanting \u2013 found to be in violation of human rights.\nThe first extant formulation of the idea of a universal natural law is from the middle of the fifth century bc . Its author is the philosophical poet Empedocles, and the text is a fragment of his poem which Aristotle quotes to illustrate the idea of universal natural justice.\nAristotle writes ( Rhetoric i .13.2, 1373b4\u201313):\nParticular law is the law which each community lays down and applies to its own members: this is partly written and partly unwritten. Universal law is law by nature. For there really is, as everyone to some extent divines, a natural justice and injustice that is common to all, even to those who have no association or covenant with each other. It is this that Sophocles\u2019 Antigone evidently means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act even though it was forbidden: she means that it was just by nature\u2026Another example is what Empedocles says about not killing any living creature. This is not something that is just for some communities, unjust for others. It is, he says,\nthe law for all, whose writ runs throughout wide-ruling air and the immense light of the sun.\nEmpedocles\u2019 claim is that there is a law common to all living things, a law binding on all and protecting all, which prohibits the taking of life. By this standard of universal justice, all actual legislations are unjust, in that they permit what should be prohibited, the taking of life. They permit it not just in war or as punishment for serious crime. The thing Empedocles most objects to is animal sacrifice, the ceremonial killing and eating of animals to honour the gods. The idea of a universal natural law was first invoked for a radical critique of ancient religion.\nEmpedocles\u2019 formulation stands at the beginning of a long tradition in Greek thought, according to which justice extends to animals other than man, with the result that to kill an animal (except in self-defence) is an injustice towards it. Aristotle's pupil and follower Theophrastus took this view. The Stoics and Epicureans opposed it. We can read the debate for and against the idea of justice towards animals in a long and learned work On Abstinence from Animal Food , written in the third century ad by the NeoPlatonist philosopher Porphyry.\nPorphyry's reason for thinking it unjust to kill and eat an animal is a surprising one: animals are rational. For modern advocates of vegetarianism the important consideration is animal suffering. Porphyry has hardly a word to say about pain and suffering. The important consideration for him, the point he spends pages proving, is that animals are nearly as rational and intelligent as we are, and often much nicer as well. The moral is that we owe duties of justice to the animals we meet, in the same way and for the same reason as we owe them to any other members of the community of rational beings.\nEmpedocles may have thought something similar in that the background to his proclamation of a universal natural law against taking life is his theory of the transmigration of souls: the animal you kill has a soul just like yours, a soul that once lived in a human body. But whatever the grounds for the prohibition on taking life, in this debate about sacrifice and meat-eating we have a number of ancient thinkers who formulate the proposition that it is unjust to take animal life save in self-defence. It is unjust in the sense that it is prohibited by some sort of natural law, even though it is allowed by the ordinary religious and civil laws of all ancient societies.\nNow let us consider the beneficiaries of this prohibition: the furry and feathered creatures whom human beings are forbidden to kill by a law that is prior and superior to ordinary human law. The lives of these animals are protected by the prohibition. Do they have, in consequence, a right to life? Is this ancient debate the beginning of the idea of animal rights?\nFor many purposes the answer to both these questions would be \u2018Yes\u2019. If animals have a liberty of life which is protected under natural law by a prohibition on the taking of life, that, by the Hohfeldian analysis, amounts to a right to live one's life and not be eaten. But for the purpose of the present debate I think we should be cautious.\nI said that Hohfeld's analysis is the first word on what a right is, not the last. It is the first word because it provides a clear statement of the conditions under which a right exists. A right exists when and only when other people have a duty not to interfere. But it is not the last word because it does not tackle the question why the right exists. More recent philosophers have found it important to distinguish the case where a right results from the imposing of a duty and the case where a duty results from the granting of a right. In his book Taking Rights Seriously an influential American jurist of our own day, Ronald Dworkin, explains the distinction in the following terms (p. 171):\nThere is a difference between the idea that you have a duty not to lie to me because I have a right not to be lied to, and the idea that I have a right that you not lie to me because you have a duty not to tell lies. In the first case I justify a duty by calling attention to a right; if I intend any further justification it is the right that I must justify, and I cannot do so by calling attention to the duty. In the second case it is the other way around. The difference is important because\u2026a theory that takes rights as fundamental is a theory of a different character from one that takes duties as fundamental.\nThere is no doubt that in the ancient theory we have been looking at it is the duty not to take life that comes first in the order of justification; the animal's right to life is derivative. The animal has a right not to be killed and eaten because we do wrong to kill and eat it. Not: we would do wrong to kill and eat it because the animal has the right to life. I would suggest that it is only when this second formulation becomes dominant that we should speak of people having a concept of animal rights.\nThe same goes for human rights. I have concentrated on animals because in the tradition founded by Empedocles they were the beneficiaries of one single natural law. Mrs Thatcher is more likely to have had in view the Stoic theory of natural law, which postulates a complete system of laws, grounded in nature and binding on all rational creatures. The lower animals do not benefit from this system, because it is Stoic doctrine that they are not rational and cannot have association or covenant with humans. But humans benefit. To the extent that actual laws reflect the prescriptions of natural law, they will not only guarantee security of life and limb, but will prohibit a whole range of injustices. For example, legislation which fails to uphold the ancient rule that travelling strangers must be helped to find their way is to be condemned for violation of natural law.\nBut multiplying the number and range of natural law prescriptions does not change the issue. However many statements I found in the ancient world about duties under natural law towards fellow human beings, I should not want to speak of a concept of human rights until the beneficiaries come first in the order of justification. I should not want to speak of a concept of human rights even though the statements in question would be equivalent, on Hohfeld's analysis, to statements of rights. What would be missing is not the satisfaction of further conditions, but the point of the concept of human rights as we have it today.\nThis is why I said at the beginning that we need to get clear about what it is to have the concept of human rights. When discussing Porphyry and the duty not to take life, I suggested that although this duty could be correlated with a right to life for all animals, putting it that way still does not give the ancients the concept of animal rights as we have it today. The difference comes out when we follow Dworkin's lead and look for the further justification. In the ancient world, one would enlarge on the reasons why I should not be unjust towards animals. It is because I would not be a good and virtuous person unless I was just. Justice is one of the virtues, and the virtues are necessary not only for moral goodness but also for happiness. All the ancient thinkers insist that evil-doing brings misery: only the good are truly happy. So the ultimate reason for respecting animal life is not that it will make the animals happy, but that it will make me happy.\nThe same reasoning applies to my duties of justice towards fellow human beings and theirs towards me. The ultimate reason why we should respect each other's rights is because justice is an essential part of our own happiness.\nFrom a modern point of view, this is a remarkably idealistic conception. It supposes that a shared concern for virtue and justice can be motive enough for the members of a social community to live harmoniously together. In the modern world we have grown used to the idea that the great problem of political community is how to cope with the fact that people have different values and incompatible conceptions of the right way to live. It was for such a world, at a time when religious and political dissension was particularly threatening, that the concept of rights came to occupy a central place in political thought.\nRights belong to individuals and bring benefit to them. Duties are imposed on individuals and restrict their freedom. So to take rights as basic and derive duties from them, instead of the other way round, is to take individuals as the prime beneficiaries of the civil order \u2013 all individuals equally. That is why in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the idea of natural rights became the organising principle of resistance to the arbitrary rule of kings and barons. Having a concept is not just a matter of making certain statements with certain truth-conditions. The statements are made in a context and for a purpose; ways of thinking are entwined with ways of living and with ways of changing the conditions of life. On 26 August 1789 the French National Assembly adopted a \u2018Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen\u2019, which includes the statement:\nThe final end of every political institution is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are those of liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression.\nThe purpose of this statement was to promote a new social order in which each and every individual would benefit from the protections of the law as of right , not because it is good and virtuous for others to benefit them.\nThe negative aim was as important as the positive. There had earlier been a vote on whether a declaration of rights should be accompanied by a declaration of duties. \u2018If a declaration is necessary\u2019, said the Bishop of Chartres on 3 August, \u2018there is a pitfall to avoid. There is a risk of awakening egoism and pride. The flattering expression of rights must be accompanied by duties as a corrective .\u2019 The opposition replied that duties were simply the corollary of rights and so needed no explicit declaration of their own. The opposition won. The demand for a declaration of duties was defeated by 570 votes to 433: not a huge majority, but enough to ensure that in the new social order rights would be prior to duties. 1\nThe new social order did not come about; the Terror intervened. But the idea lived on, and because it lived on our politics puts the individual first in a way that ancient politics did not. The difficulty is not that the statement just quoted from the Declaration of Rights could not be translated into ancient Greek. It could. But it would sound strange and pointless in a world which never seriously challenged the institution of slavery. In our politics certain minimum decencies are due to each and every individual without their having to deserve or qualify for them; their being human is enough. And that, it seems to me, is progress. Every human being, just because they are human, had reason to join in the celebrations in Paris in 1989.\n1 This paragraph is indebted to the fascinating blow by blow account of the debates in Baker (1994) esp. 181\u20133."], "citation_links": ["https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/explorations-in-ancient-and-modern-philosophy/did-the-ancient-greeks-have-the-concept-of-human-rights/731D77928DB206C9479A5E49C915F504"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_0c459cbd-2854-4250-9730-56241d5123d6"}

Silicon dioxide is a compound of group 4 elements that has a grayish-clear crystal structure that is odorless and irritating to the eyes and skin. It is not toxic to humans.", "references": ["The trend from non-metal to metal down the group is evident in the structures of the elements themselves. Carbon, at the top of the group, forms large network covalent structures in its two most familiar allotropes: diamond and graphite. Diamond has a three-dimensional structure of carbon atoms each bonded covalently to 4 other atoms. This diagram shows a representative portion of that structure:This structure is also found in silicon and germanium and in one of the allotropes of tin, \"grey tin\" or \"alpha-tin\". The more common allotrope of tin (\"white tin\" or \"beta-tin\") is metallic, with its atoms held together by metallic bonds. The structure is a distorted close-packed arrangement. In a close-packed structure, each atom is surrounded by 12 neighboring atoms. In lead and the heavier elements, the atoms are arranged in a 12-coordinated metallic structure. From this information, it is clear that there is a trend from the typical covalency found in non-metals to the metallic bonding in metals, with an obvious inflection point between the two common tin allotropes.\n- Carbon in its diamond allotrope is very hard, reflecting the strength of the covalent bonds. However, if a diamond is hit with a hammer, it shatters.\n- Silicon, germanium and grey tin (all with the same structure as diamond) are also brittle solids.\n- However, white tin and lead have metallic structures. The atoms can move around without any permanent disruption of the metallic bonds; this leads to typical metallic properties like malleability and ductility. Lead in particular is fairly soft.\n- Diamond does not conduct electricity. In diamond the electrons are all tightly bound and not free to move.\n- Silicon, germanium and grey tin are semiconductors.\n- White tin and lead are metallic conductors.\nNone of the Group 4 elements form 1+ ions, so looking at the first ionization energy alone is not helpful. Some of the elements do, however, form 2+ and (to some extent) 4+ ions. The first chart shows how the total ionization energy needed to form the 2+ ions varies down the group. The values are all reported in kJ mol -1 .\nThe ionization energies decrease down the group, although there is a slight increase at lead. The trend exists because:\n- The atoms are getting bigger because of the extra layers of electrons. The farther the outer electrons are from the nucleus, the less they are attracted; therefore, they are easier to remove.\n- The outer electrons are screened from the full effect of the nucleus by the increasing number of inner electrons.\n- These two effects outweigh the effect of increasing nuclear charge."], "citation_links": ["https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Block/2_p-Block_Elements/Group_14%3A_The_Carbon_Family/1Group_14%3A_General_Chemistry/The_Trend_from_Non-Metal_to_Metal_in_Group_4_Elements"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_e656924a-ec89-40a8-a0a3-eca2696710b9"}

We are an Islamic army.\"\nAnother recent video, also directed at Americans: \"We will drown all of you in blood.\"\nThese are ISIS' true colors. Unlike other terrorist groups, ISIS has grown into a sophisticated military force and is estimated to have between 10,000 and 20,000 fighters. The group now firmly controls large swaths of territory in both Syria and Iraq.\nThe threat ISIS poses cannot be overstated. This is the most vicious, well-funded and militant terrorist organization we have ever seen, and it is very quickly consolidating its power.\nThis is why I strongly believe the United States must lead an aggressive, international effort to confront and eliminate ISIS, including sustained airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. President Obama has now said that he intends to \"degrade and destroy\" ISIS. I look forward to hearing the specifics of the president's plan when he speaks on Wednesday. We either confront ISIS now or we'll have to confront it later \u2014 when it will be a much stronger enemy.\nWeary of war\nI recognize the reluctance of many Americans to engage in another war in the Middle East. But it is imperative that every American is fully cognizant of how dangerous and deadly ISIS really is.\nFirst, ISIS is utterly ruthless in its fighting and governance. Last month, a United Nations human rights panel report described the many crimes against humanity ISIS commits on a daily basis. The report notes that \"executions in public spaces have become a common spectacle.\"\nIn total, the U.N. reports at least 693 child casualties at the hands of ISIS this year. And at least 2,250 women and children are currently detained by the group.\nISIS has killed, enslaved and captured thousands in its efforts at ethnic cleansing, including the Yazidis in Sinjar and the Turkmen in Amerli. Overall, more than a million Iraqis have been displaced.\nSadly, these statistics are just the tip of the iceberg because it is nearly impossible to get a full accounting of the extent of ISIS' brutality on the ground in Iraq and Syria. There are likely thousands of more stories of suffering \u2014 of public lashings, rape, abductions, torture and genocidal acts \u2014 that have yet to be proved.\nSophisticated operation\nSecond, ISIS is a sophisticated terrorist army. There is an extremely high level of organization in ISIS operations and ISIS-controlled territory, almost reminiscent of a military dictatorship. ISIS controls extensive resources, military vehicles, heavy weapons and border crossings between Iraq and Syria. It has become a de facto terrorist state. Experts estimate that ISIS now has cash and assets worth $2 billion. ISIS adds as much as $1 million per day through extortion, crime, ransom and even the sale of oil on the black market from the several oil fields it controls.\nISIS is also governing effectively, albeit brutally. It has put in place judicial systems, traffic police and inspectors to ensure sharia law is followed and crime is punished.\nMost disturbing is what it seeks to do next. ISIS has its sights set on taking control of additional areas in the Middle East, including Baghdad, where it is already interspersing among the civilian population in Sunni areas.\nBut ISIS' aspirations don't stop there. In an audio message, the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said, \"Our last message is to the Americans. Soon we will be in direct confrontation, and the sons of Islam have prepared for such a day. So watch, for we are with you, watching.\"\nI understand that many Americans don't want to become mired in another war. The conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have claimed thousands of American lives and cost more than $1 trillion. But Americans need to understand ISIS' degree of viciousness as well as what will happen in the absence of U.S. leadership and action.\nIf the United States fails to unite and lead the world against ISIS' horrific goals, we could suffer the consequences for decades to come.\nSen.

Yet same-sex marriage remains banned in many countries, and the expansion of broader LGBTQ+ rights has been uneven globally. International organizations, including the United Nations, have issued resolutions in support of LGBTQ+ rights, but human rights groups say these organizations have limited power to enforce them.\nRelated\nRights monitors find a strong correlation between LGBTQ+ rights and democratic societies; the research and advocacy group Freedom House lists nearly all the countries with marriage equality\u2014when same-sex couples have the same legal right to marriage as different-sex couples\u2014as \u201cfree.\u201d \u201cWherever you see restrictions on individuals\u2014in terms of speech, expression, or freedom of assembly\u2014you see a crackdown on LGBT rights,\u201d says Julie Dorf, senior advisor to the Council for Global Equality, a Washington-based group that promotes LGBTQ+ rights in U.S. foreign policy. \u201cIt\u2019s the canary in the coal mine,\u201d she says.\nJavier Corrales, a professor at Amherst College who focuses on LGBTQ+ rights in Latin America, points to income levels and the influence of religion in politics, as well as the overall strength of democracy, to explain regional divergences [PDF].\nThe World This Week\nThe UN Human Rights Council, expressing \u201cgrave concern\u201d over violence and discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation and gender identity, commissioned the body\u2019s first study on the topic [PDF] in 2011. In 2014, the council passed a resolution to combat anti-LGBTQ+ violence and discrimination. Two years later, the United Nations appointed its first-ever independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity. \u201cWhat is important here is the gradual building of consensus,\u201d says Graeme Reid, director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights program at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThere\u2019s an accumulation of moral pressure on member states to at least address the most overt forms of discrimination or violence.\u201d\nActivists have focused on antiviolence and antidiscrimination campaigns rather than marriage equality. \u201cThere\u2019s no sensible diplomat who would think that pushing same-sex marriage on a country that\u2019s not ready for it is a good idea,\u201d says Dorf. She adds that not all countries with marriage equality allow same-sex couples to jointly adopt and cautions against equating the right to marry with freedom from discrimination. Still, antidiscrimination laws are gaining traction worldwide. In 2020, eighty-one countries and territories, including some that retain sodomy laws, had protections against employment discrimination [PDF] based on gender identity or sexual orientation.\nExpanding LGBTQ+ Rights and Protections\nCountries listed as having antidiscrimination laws have at least one protection for LGBTQ+ individuals.\nSources : CFR research; Pew Research Center; Marriage Equality USA; ILGA.\nIn 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the Constitution grants same-sex couples the right to marry. The 5-4 ruling effectively legalized same-sex marriage in the thirteen states where it remained banned and extended to U.S. territories. In 2022, amid fears that the Supreme Court could rule to let states deny the validity of same-sex marriages, Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act , which recognizes such marriages at the federal level. That year, 71 percent of Americans polled approved of same-sex marriage, up from 27 percent in 1996.\nDespite the increase in public support for same-sex marriage, debate continues between advocates of legal equality and individuals and institutions that object to marriage equality on the basis of religious belief. In 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because of his religious beliefs, violating the state\u2019s civil rights law. However, the court chose not to issue a broader ruling on whether businesses have a right to deny goods or services to LGBTQ+ people for religious reasons. In 2020, the court ruled that a 1964 civil rights law prohibiting sex discrimination in the workplace also applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The ruling protected LGBTQ+ employees from being fired in more than half of states where no such legal protections previously existed.\nHowever, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade , a case that used the fourteenth amendment to protect the right to have an abortion, sparked some concerns that it would similarly overturn its 2015 decision on marriage equality. In his concurring opinion on the 2022 ruling, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that Obergefell v. Hodges was \u201c demonstrably erroneous \u201d and that the court had a duty to overrule this and other decisions.\nMore than half of the countries that have marriage equality are in Western Europe. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in the Netherlands (2001), Belgium (2003), Spain (2005), Norway (2009), Sweden (2009), Portugal (2010), Iceland (2010), Denmark (2012), France (2013), the United Kingdom (2013), Luxembourg (2015), Ireland (2015), Finland (2017), Malta (2017), Germany (2017), Austria (2019), and Switzerland (2021). In Italy, the parliament approved civil unions for same-sex couples in 2016, but same-sex marriage is not legal. Lawmakers in Andorra voted in 2022 to convert all same-sex civil unions to civil marriages and legalize same-sex marriage. The changes will take effect in early 2023. Meanwhile, Slovenia made history in 2022 as the first country of the former Yugoslavia to legalize marriage and adoption for same-sex couples.\n\u201cMore than half of the countries that have marriage equality are in Western Europe.\u201d\nDespite this, same-sex marriage remains restricted in much of Central and Eastern Europe. A 2019 Pew Research Center poll found that support for legal recognition of same-sex marriage was 28 percent in Lithuania and 14 percent in Ukraine. Support in Poland and Hungary has increased in recent years, to 47 percent and 49 percent, respectively, though both maintain bans on same-sex marriage. At least ten other countries in Central and Eastern Europe have such prohibitions. Estonia allows civil unions, though popular support for marriage equality in the Baltic states is low. The Czech Republic and Hungary recognize same-sex partnerships. In 2018, a Budapest court ruled that same-sex marriages performed abroad must be recognized as partnerships. Since then, however, Hungarian lawmakers and populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban have passed several anti-LGBTQ+ laws, including ones that prohibit same-sex couples from adopting children and ban any content deemed to promote being gay or transgender from being distributed to people under the age of eighteen. The European Union (EU) condemned the laws as discriminatory.\nIn 2013, Russia made it a crime to distribute \u201cpropaganda of nontraditional sexual relationships among minors.\u201d Dozens of people have been fined for violations , including participating in protests and sharing articles on social media. Human rights groups say the law is a tool for anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, and Europe\u2019s top human rights court ruled that it is discriminatory and violates freedom of expression. In 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law an expansion of the ban . It prohibited the distribution of such material to adults, made it illegal to treat same-sex relationships as \u201cnormal,\u201d and increased penalties against people who violate the law. Meanwhile, in Chechnya, a semiautonomous republic within Russia, dozens of men suspected of being gay have been detained, tortured, and even killed in two separate official crackdowns since 2017.\nThe EU does not require its members to recognize same-sex marriage, though a 2018 ruling [PDF] by the EU\u2019s top court says they must uphold same-sex couples\u2019 rights to freedom of movement and residence. In 2021, the court ruled that all EU countries must recognize children of same-sex couples, even countries that do not have marriage equality. The ruling came after Bulgaria refused to grant identity documents to the daughter of a same-sex couple. A 2013 European Parliament report on human rights and democracy \u201cencourages\u201d EU institutions and member states to recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions as \u201ca political, social and human and civil rights issue \u201d [PDF]; however, the EU is not able to impose such policy changes on its members.\nIn 2005, Canada became the first country in the Western Hemisphere to legalize same-sex marriage. It was followed by Argentina in 2010, Brazil and Uruguay in 2013, Mexico in 2015, Colombia in 2016, Ecuador in 2019, Costa Rica in 2020, and Chile in 2021. The only Central American country to recognize same-sex couples is Costa Rica, though some others in the region have limited antidiscrimination protections.\nSupport for marriage equality varies across the region. According to a 2016 survey [PDF] by the International LGBTI Association (ILGA), 54 percent of Canadians, 48 percent of Chileans, and 57 percent of Argentines were in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. In Central America, support was much lower: 33 percent of Costa Ricans, 28 percent of Nicaraguans, and 27 percent of Ecuadorians supported legalizing it. In 2018, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of marriage equality, but the decision has not spurred much action among member states.\nSupport for legalizing same-sex marriage also remains low in the Caribbean, at just 16 percent in Jamaica and 23 percent in the Dominican Republic, according to the ILGA. Bermuda, a British territory, legalized domestic partnerships for same-sex couples in 2017, but the government fought to reissue a ban. Same-sex marriage remains illegal there. However, in 2022, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis struck down laws criminalizing gay sex.\nThe governments of Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Paraguay have enacted constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. Although Brazil has legalized same-sex marriage, in 2019, then-President Jair Bolsonaro removed the Human Rights Ministry\u2019s ability to consider LGBTQ+ concerns. He drew criticism from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups during his campaign over homophobic remarks .\nCuba, where homosexuality was once punished by internment in forced-labor camps , has changed markedly in recent years. The National Assembly passed an antidiscrimination law in 2013, and a new constitution in 2019 removed language defining marriage as between a man and a woman. In September 2022, voters approved a referendum legalizing same-sex marriage.\nAustralia and New Zealand are the only Pacific Rim countries in which same-sex marriage is legal. Same-sex marriage became legal in Taiwan in 2019, as the legislature implemented a ruling the top court issued two years earlier. In China, 43 percent of people supported legalizing same-sex marriage in 2021.\nA district in Tokyo began recognizing same-sex unions in 2015, amid rapidly shifting public opinion in Japan. In 2022, the city adopted legislation granting same-sex couples some privileges enjoyed by married couples. A court in Sapporo ruled a year earlier that the Japanese government\u2019s refusal to recognize same-sex marriages is unconstitutional, while a court in Osaka ruled that it is constitutional. In a 2022 survey, public support for same-sex marriage reached nearly 65 percent.\nIn 2022, a court in Seoul, South Korea, ruled against recognizing same-sex partnerships and rejected a same-sex couple\u2019s claim to spousal health insurance, even though public opinion supports antidiscrimination legislation. More than a third of people in South Korea supported legalizing same-sex marriage in 2021.\n\u201cAustralia and New Zealand are the only Pacific Rim countries in which same-sex marriage is legal.\u201d\nLawmakers in Thailand and Vietnam have considered bills to legalize same-sex marriage or civil partnerships. However, in 2021, Thailand\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that the nation\u2019s marriage law\u2014which only recognizes marriage between a man and a woman\u2014does not violate the constitution. The country\u2019s parliament is considering two proposals that will essentially give lawmakers a choice between permitting civil partnerships for same-sex couples and allowing them to marry. In the Philippines, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has said that if there is popular support for same-sex unions, it is up to lawmakers to legalize it. However, he has maintained his own opposition to same-sex marriage.\nSame-sex relations between men are banned in parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar. Rights groups have reported increased threats and violence against LGBTQ+ people in Indonesia since 2016, including discriminatory comments by several public officials. Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong vowed in 2022 to decriminalize gay sex but said this would not change the status quo on marriage. In Brunei, gay sex is punishable by stoning to death , though following international outcry, the government said it won\u2019t enforce the law.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in much of South and Central Asia [PDF], including in Bangladesh and Pakistan. In 2018, India lifted a colonial-era ban on gay sex, and in 2020, Bhutan moved to decriminalize it. In 2022, India\u2019s Supreme Court ruled to expand the definition of family to include \u201catypical\u201d families, such as same-sex couples, though same-sex marriage remains illegal. Nepal has enacted some protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 2015 a government-appointed panel recommended that lawmakers legalize same-sex marriage. Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan allow people to register as a third gender in official documents.\nThere is little information on public attitudes toward homosexuality in South and Central Asia. ILGA found 35 percent of Indians and 30 percent of Pakistanis in 2016 thought same-sex marriage should be legal. Support in Kazakhstan stood at 12 percent.\nSupport for same-sex marriage has historically been low in Afghanistan. According to a 2022 Human Rights Watch report , the Taliban\u2019s takeover in 2021 \u201cdramatically worsened\u201d LGBTQ+ people\u2019s lives, with individuals reporting attacks, sexual assaults, and direct threats against them or their families.\nSame-sex relations are illegal in much of the region and are punishable by death in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Algeria, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia, and Gaza have laws explicitly prohibiting same-sex acts. When Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup, its anti-LGBTQ+ laws were widely criticized; it prohibits gay sex, and security forces have assaulted transgender women and other LGBTQ+ people, according to Human Rights Watch.\nIn 2018, Lebanese courts set a potential precedent for the decriminalization of gay sex, but the country continued to crack down on peaceful LGBTQ+ gatherings in 2021 and banned them outright in 2022.\nIsrael recognizes same-sex marriages performed in other countries, but a bill that would have legalized same-sex marriages failed to pass in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s legislative assembly, in 2018. Same-sex couples enjoy civil benefits, including residency permits for the partners of Israeli citizens, and they were granted the right to use surrogates to have children in 2022.\nIsrael stands apart from its neighbors in public attitudes toward same-sex couples: according to the 2016 ILGA survey, 49 percent of Israelis said same-sex marriage should be legal, compared to 19 percent of respondents in the United Arab Emirates, 16 percent in Egypt, and 14 percent in both Jordan and Morocco.\nSouth Africa is the only sub-Saharan African country where same-sex couples can marry. The parliament legalized same-sex marriage in 2006 , less than a decade after the constitutional court struck down laws banning sex between men. The postapartheid constitution was the world\u2019s first to protect people on the basis of sexual orientation, though the 2016 ILGA poll found only 40 percent of South Africans were in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, and human rights monitors have reported failures by security forces to uphold rights of lesbians and transgender men.\n\u201cSouth Africa is the only sub-Saharan African country where same-sex couples can marry.\u201d\nSame-sex relations are illegal on much of the continent and are punishable by death in Mauritania and Sudan, as well as in parts of Nigeria and Somalia. Polling by Afrobarometer between 2016 and 2018 found that 78 percent [PDF] of Africans across thirty-four countries were intolerant of homosexuality. Although the African Union\u2019s human rights commission adopted a resolution condemning violence against LGBTQ+ people in 2014, a group of African nations attempted to suspend the appointment of a UN expert charged with investigating anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in 2016.

There are laws and regulations which enforce this principle. However, opinions on whether net neutrality should be regulated vary. Some argue that regulation is unnecessary because broadband service providers have no plans to block content or degrade network performance. Others believe that regulation is necessary to ensure equal treatment of all internet communications. Would you like more information on this topic?", "references": ["After the Federal Communications Commission's Restoring Internet Freedom Order and transparency rule amendments became effective June 11, 2018, overturning earlier requirements on net neutrality requirements on internet service providers, state legislators responded by introducing net neutrality legislation at the state level.\nNet neutrality is the concept that all data traffic on a network should be treated indiscriminately, where internet service providers (ISPs) would be restricted from blocking, slowing down or speeding up the delivery of online content at their discretion. The current debate surrounding net neutrality is principally about how ISPs should be regulated and what role government should play in overseeing their network management practices.\nThe rule change places primary jurisdiction over internet service providers\u2019 network management practices under the Federal Trade Commission and preempts states from enacting similar ISP network restrictions as found in the 2015 Open Internet Order .\nAttorneys general from more than 20 states, nonprofits and internet groups filed suit against the FCC's Restoring Internet Freedom Order, arguing that the FCC action was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. In October 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued its ruling, upholding the 2018 order, with two exceptions. First, the court concluded that the FCC had not shown legal authority to issue its Preemption Directive, which would have barred states from imposing any rule or requirement that the Commission \u201crepealed or decided to refrain from imposing\u201d in the order or that is \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the order. The court vacated that portion of the order. Second, the court remanded the order to the FCC on three discrete issues: (1) The order failed to examine the implications of its decisions for public safety; (2) the order does not sufficiently explain what reclassification will mean for regulation of pole attachments; and (3) the agency did not adequately address petitioners\u2019 concerns about the effects of broadband reclassification on the Lifeline Program.\nSeven states\u2014California, Colorado, Maine, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and Washington\u2014and Puerto Rico enacted legislation or adopted resolutions in previous legislative sessions. In a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, California agreed to not enforce its net neutrality law until the lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of the federal regulations is resolved.\nTwelve states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico introduced net neutrality legislation in the 2020 legislative session.\nSeparately, legislators have introduced measures that would restrict ISPs\u2019 use of customer information and adopt privacy protections. For example, two states, Nevada and Minnesota prohibit disclosure of personally identifying information, but Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing information about the subscribers' online surfing habits and internet sites visited."], "citation_links": ["https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/net-neutrality-2020-legislation"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_51fb608e-3f60-476e-8237-5e1982d84cdc"}

It was located at the corner of Brooklyn Avenue and E. 22nd Street.\nMunicipal Stadium hosted both the minor-league Kansas City Blues of the American Association and the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues from 1923 to 1955.\nThe stadium was almost completely rebuilt prior to the 1955 baseball season when the Kansas City Athletics moved to Kansas City from Philadelphia . The A's played from 1955 to 1967, the Kansas City Royals from 1969 to 1972, the Kansas City Chiefs ( American Football League and National Football League ) from 1963 to 1971 and the Kansas City Spurs ( North American Soccer League ) from 1968\u20131969.\nThe stadium hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1960 (first game) . In the final football game played there, Municipal Stadium was the site of the longest NFL game in history, a playoff game between the Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins on Christmas Day 1971 ; the Chiefs moved to the new Arrowhead Stadium in 1972. Jackie Robinson played at the stadium for the Kansas City Monarchs in 1945 until he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers .\nThe stadium opened in 1923 as Muehlebach Field . It was named for George E. Muehlebach, who owned the Blues and a number of other Kansas City businesses, including Muehlebach Beer and the Muehlebach Hotel . It was built for the minor-league Blues for $400,000. It served as a replacement for the Blues' previous home, Association Park, whose railroad company owner decided to build tracks through the outfield in 1922. [1]\nLocated in the inner-city neighborhood near 18th and Vine , the stadium first housed the minor-league white Kansas City Blues baseball team and the Negro league Kansas City Monarchs . [2] [3] The first Negro World Series game was held at the stadium in 1924 . The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum , founded in 1990, is a few blocks from the site. [4]\nThe stadium consisted of a single-decked, mostly covered, grandstand, extending from the right-field foul pole down and around most of the left-field line. When the New York Yankees bought the Blues as its top farm team in 1937, the stadium was renamed Ruppert Stadium in honor of the Yankees' owner, Col. Jacob Ruppert . [5] Ruppert died two years later and the stadium was renamed Blues Stadium in 1943.\nArnold Johnson , a Chicago real estate magnate, bought both Blues Stadium and Yankee Stadium in 1953. Johnson then bought the Philadelphia Athletics from Connie Mack in November 1954, announcing plans to move the A's from Philadelphia to Kansas City. Johnson then sold Blues Stadium to the city, who renamed it Municipal Stadium and leased it back to the A's.\nMuehlebach had anticipated that Kansas City would eventually get a major league team. Accordingly, he designed the stadium with footings that were theoretically strong enough to support a future upper deck. However, when work began on double-decking the stadium for the A's, it was discovered that three decades of harsh Midwestern winters had weakened the footings until they could no longer support the weight of an upper deck. City officials elected to completely demolish the stadium's footings and rebuild them from scratch. The city ran three shifts and the new stadium was built in 90 days, completed in time for the 1955 season opener. The new construction was financed by a bond issuance. The expanded stadium was supposed to seat 38,000, but cost overruns as a result of overtime payments forced officials to reduce capacity to just over 30,000. [6] The Braves Field scoreboard in Boston was purchased for $100,000 and moved from Boston to Kansas City, while temporary bleachers were added in the left field corner and parts of the outfield. [7]\nOn opening day 1955, former President Harry S Truman , a resident of nearby Independence , threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Connie Mack and legendary A's player Jimmie Foxx were also in attendance. The A's defeated the Detroit Tigers, 8\u20132. [7]\nThe baseball field was aligned northeast (home plate to center field) at an approximate elevation of 900 feet (270 m) above sea level .\nFrom 1923 to 1955, the stadium was also home to the Negro leagues' longest-running team, the Kansas City Monarchs . The Monarchs won 11 league championships before integration (1923\u201325, 1929, 1931 in the NNL; 1937\u201340, 1942, 1946 in the NAL). They appeared in four Negro World Series . They won the first Series in 1924 and lost the second in 1925 . They won the 1942 Negro World Series , and lost the 1946 Series. [ citation needed ]\nMany noteworthy players played for the Monarchs at Muelbach Field. The legendary Buck O'Neil played 10 seasons for the Monarchs.\nAfter being discharged from the United States Army, Jackie Robinson signed with the Monarchs for the 1945 season. He played shortstop and was selected to play in the East-West All-Star game. While playing for the Monarchs, Robinson was scouted by the Dodgers' Branch Rickey , who signed Robinson on October 23, 1945. [ citation needed ] Robinson broke the color barrier in the Major Leagues on April 15, 1947. [ citation needed ]\nThe Kansas City Blues were one of the eight founding members of the American Association . The franchise existed in its entirety from 1888\u20131954, and was an original tenant of Municipal Stadium. The franchise was a top-level farm team for the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees . The franchise was an AA team (1923\u20131945) and then an AAA team (1946\u201354). [8] The city's longtime support of the Blues helped the team eventually land Major League Franchises. [9]\nAs one of the Yankees' top farm teams (sharing that status with the Newark Bears for much of the time) the Blues had many great players and successes. The 1939 Blues have been called one of the greatest minor league teams of all time. That team was led by Hall of Fame player (and future Yankee Announcer) Phil Rizzuto and Vince Dimaggio , who hit 46 home runs. [10] [11]\nA young Mickey Mantle hit .361 with 11 HR for the Blues in 1951. [12]\nMickey Mantle , Whitey Ford , Ralph Houk , Al Rosen , Billy Martin , Bill Virdon , Johnny Mize and Elston Howard were some of the players in the Yankees farm era who played for the Blues. There were about 580 Blues players who went on to the Major Leagues. [13]\nThe stadium was home to many of the shenanigans of Charlie Finley , who bought the A's after Arnold Johnson's death in 1960 . Most notably, he tried to shorten the rather distant fences in April 1964 by creating a 296 feet (90 m) Pennant Porch in right field, fronting a tiny bleacher section, to mock the famed short fence in right field at Yankee Stadium , home of the powerful Yankees . [14] The move was quickly vetoed by the league, [15] so Finley rebuilt the fence to the bare legal minimum of 325 feet (99 m), and repainted the fence to say \"One-Half Pennant Porch\". Later he tried the ruse of putting a canopy over the little bleacher, which just happened to have an extension that reached out 29 feet (9 m) over the field. The league, not amused by Finley's sense of humor, again ordered him to cease and desist. According to legend, on a road trip that the A's made to New York, a Yankee hitter lofted a long fly ball to left field which, in the cavernous left field of Yankee Stadium, became a routine out. Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard is alleged to have then said over the microphone, \"In Kansas City, that would have been a home run\", itself a response to Finley's dictum for Municipal Stadium public address announcer Jack Layton to announce, \"That would have been a home run at Yankee Stadium\" for any ball hit beyond a line Finley painted in the outfield grass 296 feet away from home plate in Kansas City. Supposedly, Layton's gimmick was short-lived after Finley noticed the vast majority of the \"would've been home runs\" were being hit by the Athletics' opponents.\nIn addition to his notorious tinkering with the right-field corner, Finley experimented with moving the other fences in and out several times during his seven seasons operating the team here. None of those moves had any notable effect on the team's performance, as the club finished in or near last place nearly every year.\nA small zoo with goats and sheep and picnic area stood behind the right-field fence. When home runs were hit into the field the goats and sheep would scamper up the hill. At the same time, Finley replaced the Athletics' old elephant mascot with a live mule, appropriately named \" Charlie-O \".\nAt home plate a mechanical rabbit, nicknamed \"Harvey\" in reference to the stage play Harvey (1944) and the subsequent film of the same name (1950), rose out of the ground with new baseballs for the umpire and a compressed-air device (nicknamed \"Little Blowhard\") blew dirt off of home plate.\nReggie Jackson , Sal Bando , Catfish Hunter , Joe Rudi and Gene Tenace were some young A's players who debuted in Kansas City and went on to lead them in their World Series victories in Oakland. Hunter and Jackson would earn Hall of Fame induction. [16]\nMunicipal Stadium's fate was sealed when, as part of the AFL\u2013NFL merger , all teams were required to have a minimum stadium capacity of 50,000 people; at its height, Municipal Stadium only seated 35,000 people for football and could not be expanded. However, a replacement would have been needed even without the merger, given its age and condition. Public bonds were issued in 1967 to fund a complex including separate football and baseball stadiums\u2014what would eventually become the Truman Sports Complex . It came too late for the A's, however, as Finley moved the franchise to Oakland after the 1967 season . Subsequently, Kansas City was awarded an American League expansion team for 1969 , and the new Kansas City Royals used the stadium as a temporary home from 1969\u20131972. [17]\nKansas City welcomed the new Royals, who were led by 1969 American League Rookie of the Year Lou Piniella . The expansion team drew nearly one million fans in their first season, despite a 69\u201393 record. [18]\nIn subsequent seasons, many future stars made their debuts for the Royals, who were building a highly competitive team, rising up to an 85\u201376 record in 1971. CF Amos Otis (1970), P Paul Splittorff (1970), SS Freddie Patek (1971), 1B John Mayberry (1972) and P Steve Busby (1972) were a core of young Royals who made their debuts at Municipal Stadium. Each went on to selection into the Royals Hall of Fame. [19] [20]\nAfter the 1972 baseball season, the Royals moved to what's now Kauffman Stadium in the Truman Sports Complex. The Royals won the final game (and event) at Municipal Stadium, a 4\u20130 win over the Texas Rangers on October 4, 1972, in what was also the final Major League game managed by Hall of Famer Ted Williams . Amos Otis scored the final run in Municipal Stadium history and Ed Kirkpatrick had the final hit. Four days prior Gene Tenace of the Oakland A's hit the final home run, and John Mayberry hit the final Royals home run the night before.\nFranchise owner Lamar Hunt moved the Dallas Texans of the fledgling American Football League (AFL) to Kansas City after the 1962 season, becoming the Kansas City Chiefs . The stadium was retrofitted for football. The playing field ran an unconventional east\u2013west, along the first base line. Temporary stands were erected in left field to expand the stadium's capacity each fall, but had to be removed during the baseball season. Due to the lower capacity without the temporary bleachers, the Chiefs opened almost every season between 1963 and 1971 with three or more consecutive road games, except 1968, the year in between the Athletics' final season in Kansas City and the Royals' first season.\nThe double-decked grandstand extended all the way across the south sideline, but ended halfway around the west end zone (third base line). Both teams' benches were on the north sideline in front of the temporary bleachers, as was the case at Wrigley Field , Tiger Stadium , Milwaukee County Stadium and Metropolitan Stadium . The east end zone ended at the right field fence, and the large scoreboard was in this end of the stadium. Due to the fence, there was significantly less room between the end line and the fence of the east end zone than there was in the west end zone, where there was a significant amount of room between the end line and the grandstand. [21]\nThe Chiefs were 44\u201316\u20133 (.722) in their tenure at Municipal Stadium and had a roster of Hall of Fame players: Quarterback Len Dawson , Defensive End Buck Buchanan , defensive tackle Curley Culp , Linebackers Bobby Bell and Willie Lanier , defensive backs Emmitt Thomas and Johnny Robinson , and Kicker Jan Stenerud . Lamar Hunt himself was the first Chief elected to the Hall, as his role as a league pioneer resulted in pro football growing from 12 to 26 franchises in the 1960s. [22] [23] In one of the great performances at the stadium, the Chiefs' Hall of Fame Quarterback Len Dawson passed for 435 yards and 6 Touchdowns against the Denver Broncos on November 1, 1964. [24]\nWhile at Municipal Stadium, the Chiefs were successful, representing the American Football League in two of the four Super Bowls before the leagues merged. As AFL Champions under Coach Hank Stram , the Chiefs won Super Bowl IV , beating the Minnesota Vikings 23\u20137. Previously, the Chiefs played in the very first, Super Bowl I , losing to the Green Bay Packers of Vince Lombardi . Leading up to the game after Lamar Hunt had first used the term \"Super Bowl\" in the local media as a term for the AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game, a phrase that was later adopted as the name. [25] Super Bowl IV was the last game played before the merger of the AFL and NFL [26] They moved to Arrowhead Stadium in the Truman Sports Complex for the 1972 season.\nThe Chiefs' final game at Municipal Stadium was played on Christmas Day 1971 and was historic. Despite a brilliant game by the Chiefs' Ed Podolak , who had 350 total yards from scrimmage, an NFL playoff record that still stands, the Chiefs were beaten by the Dolphins 27\u201324, when Garo Yepremian kicked a walk-off field goal with 7:20 left in double overtime. [27] The double-overtime playoff contest lasted 82 minutes and 40 seconds (with overtime lasting over 22 minutes) and remains the longest game in NFL history, [28] as well the only post-season football game played at Municipal Stadium.\nThe Chicago Spurs of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) relocated the franchise to Kansas City after the NPSL and the United Soccer Association formed the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1967. The Spurs, under Coach Janos Bedl , led the league in attendance, with an average of 8,510 fans. Because of scheduling conflicts with Royals baseball and Chiefs football, the Spurs relocated home matches to the football stadium at Pembroke Hill High School for the 1970 season before the club folded altogether. The Spurs' colors were red and white and their mascot was \"Cowboy Joe\". [29] [30]\nOn July 11, 1960, Municipal Stadium hosted the best major league players in front of 30,619 fans. During the years when two major league All-Star Games were scheduled each year instead of one, Municipal Stadium hosted the first of the two 1960 games , with the National League winning the contest 5\u20133. Team rosters included over 15 future Hall of Fame members. [31]\nErnie Banks , Del Crandall and Al Kaline hit home runs in the contest. [31]\nOn September 17, 1964, The Beatles played the stadium as part of their first U.S. tour . [32] The date was originally supposed to be an off-day for the band following a concert in New Orleans , but they agreed to perform when Finley offered their manager, Brian Epstein , a then-record sum of $150,000 (equivalent to $1.14 million in 2014). The group opened the Thursday night concert by saluting the host town with their medley of \" Kansas City \" and \" Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey \"; [33] a month later, they would record the medley for their fourth studio album, Beatles for Sale .\nThe stadium was demolished in 1976, and replaced by a municipal garden. Today, the former ballpark site is being redeveloped with new single family homes.\nA plaque at 22nd and Brooklyn Street marks the former stadium's location. The neighborhood still contains legendary Arthur Bryant's Barbecue at 18th and Brooklyn Street, founded in 1908, a fan and player favorite when Municipal Stadium was nearby. [34]\nWith involvement from former Monarch Buck O'Neil, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was founded in 1990 and opened in 1997.

The largest group of Americans, almost 155 million non-elderly people, were covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. Less than 1% of Americans over 65 were uninsured, thanks to Medicaid, a government provided insurance for people over 65 years old.\nThe United States is the only nation among the 37 OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) nations that does not have universal health care either in practice or by constitutional right. Read more background\u2026\nPro 1\nThe United States already has universal health care for some. The government should expand the system to protect everyone.\nA national health insurance is a universal health care that \u201cuses public insurance to pay for private-practice care. Every citizen pays into the national insurance plan. Administrative costs are lower because there is one insurance company. The government also has a lot of leverage to force medical costs down,\u201d according to economic expert Kimberly Amadeo. Canada, Taiwan, and South Korea all have national health insurance. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE function similarly. [ 178 ]\nMedicare is the \u201cfederal health insurance program for: people who are 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, [and] people with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD).\u201d Patients pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B (general health coverage). The 2023 standard Part B monthly premium is $164.90. Patients also contribute to drug costs via Medicare Part D. Most people do not pay a premium for Medicare Part A (\u201cinpatient hospital stays, care in a skilled nursing facility, hospice care, and some home health care\u201d). More than 65.3 million people were enrolled in Medicare according to Feb. 2023 government data. [ 180 ] [ 181 ]\nMedicaid \u201cprovides health coverage to millions of Americans, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by states, according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government.\u201d More than 84.8 million people were enrolled in Medicaid as of Nov. 2022. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ [ 182 ] [ [ [ 186 ]\nIf the government can successfully provide universal health care for 36% to almost 50% of the population, then the government can provide univeral health care for the rest of the population who are just as in need and deserving of leading healthy lives.\nPro 2\nUniversal health care would lower costs and prevent medical bankruptcy.\nA June 2022 study found the United States could have saved $105.6 billion in COVID-19 (coronavirus) hospitalization costs with single-payer universal health care during the pandemic. That potential savings is on top of the estimated $438 billion the researchers estimated could be saved annually with universal health care in a non-pandemic year. [ 198 ]\n\u201cTaking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act, we calculate that a single-payer, universal health-care system is likely to lead to a 13% savings in national health-care expenditure, equivalent to more than US$450 billion annually (based on the value of the US$ in 2017). The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for health-care premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to single-payer health care would provide the greatest relief to lower-income households,\u201d conclude researchers from the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues. [ 201 ]\nAccording to the National Bankruptcy Forum, medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy in the United States. In 2017, about 33% of all Americans with medical bills reported that they \u201cwere unable to pay for basic necessities like food, heat, or housing.\u201d If all Americans were provided health care under a single-payer system medical bankruptcy would no longer exist, because the government, not private citizens, would pay all medical bills. [ 131 ]\nFurther, prescription drug costs would drop between 4% and 31%, according to five cost estimates gathered by New York Times reporters. 24% of people taking prescription drugs reported difficulty affording the drugs, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll. 58% of people whose drugs cost more than $100 a month, 49% of people in fair or poor health, 35% of those with annual incomes of less than $40,000, and 35% of those taking four or more drugs monthly all reported affordability issues. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ]\nAdditionally, 30% of people aged 50 to 64 reported cost issues because they generally take more drugs than younger people but are not old enough to qualify for Medicare drug benefits. With 79% of Americans saying prescription drug costs are \u201cunreasonable,\u201d and 70% reporting lowering prescription drug costs as their highest healthcare priority, lowering the cost of prescription drugs would lead to more drug-compliance and lives not only bettered, but saved as a result. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ]\nPro 3\nUniversal health care would improve individual and national health outcomes.\nSince 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the public health, economic and moral repercussions of widespread dependence on employer-sponsored insurance, the most common source of coverage for working-age Americans\u2026. Business closures and restrictions led to unemployment for more than 9 million individuals following the emergence of COVID-19. Consequently, many Americans lost their healthcare precisely at a time when COVID-19 sharply heightened the need for medical services,\u201d argue researchers from the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues. The researchers estimated more than 131,000 COVID-19 (coronavirus) deaths and almost 78,000 non-COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented with universal health care in 2020 alone. [ 198 ]\nAnother study finds a change to \u201csingle-payer health care would\u2026 save more than 68,000 lives and 1.73 million life-years every year compared with the status quo.\u201d [ 201 ]\nMeanwhile, more people would be able to access much-needed health care. A Jan. 2021 study concludes that universal health care would increase outpatient visits by 7% to 10% and hospital visits by 0% to 3%, which are modest increases when compared to saved and lengthened lives. [ 202 ]\nOther studies find that universal health coverage is linked to longer life expectancy, lower child mortality rates, higher smoking cessation rates, lower depression rates, and a higher general sense of well-being, with more people reporting being in \u201cexcellent health.\u201d Further, universal health care leads to appropriate use of health care facilities, including lower rates of emergency room visits for non-emergencies and a higher use of preventative doctors\u2019 visits to manage chronic conditions. [ 203 ] [ 204 ] [ 205 ]\nAn American Hospital Association report argues, the \u201chigh rate of uninsured [patients] puts stress on the broader health care system. People without insurance put off needed care and rely more heavily on hospital emergency departments, resulting in scarce resources being directed to treat conditions that often could have been prevented or managed in a lower-cost setting. Being uninsured also has serious financial implications for individuals, communities and the health care system.\u201d [ 205 ]\nCon 1\nUniversal health care for everyone in the United States promises only government inefficiency and health care that ignores the realities of the country and the free market.\nIn addition to providing universal health care for the elderly, low-income individuals, children in need, and military members (and their families), the United States has the Affordable Care Act (the ACA, formerly known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act), or Obamacare, which ensures that Americans can access affordable health care. the ACA allows Americans to chose the coverage appropriate to their health conditions and incomes. [ 187 ]\nVeterans\u2019 Affairs, which serves former military members, is an example of a single-payer health care provider, and one that has repeatedly failed its patients. For example, a computer error at the Spokane VA hospital \u201cfailed to deliver more than 11,000 orders for specialty care, lab work and other services \u2013 without alerting health care providers the orders had been lost.\u201d [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\nElizabeth Hovde, Policy Analyst and Director of the Centers for Health Care and Worker Rights, argues, \u201cThe VA system is not only costly with inconsistent medical care results, it\u2019s an American example of a single-payer, government-run system. We should run from the attempts in our state to decrease competition in the health care system and increase government dependency, leaving our health care at the mercy of a monopolistic system that does not need to be timely or responsive to patients. Policymakers should give veterans meaningful choices among private providers, clinics and hospitals, so vets can choose their own doctors and directly access quality care that meets their needs. Best of all, when the routine break-downs of a government-run system threaten to harm them again, as happened in Spokane, veterans can take their well-earned health benefit and find help elsewhere.\u201d [ 188 ] [ 189 ]\nFurther, the challenges of universal health care implementation are vastly different in the U.S. than in other countries, making the current patchwork of health care options the best fit for the country. As researchers summarize, \u201cThough the majority of post-industrial Westernized nations employ a universal healthcare model, few\u2014if any\u2014of these nations are as geographically large, populous, or ethnically/racially diverse as the U.S. Different regions in the U.S. are defined by distinct cultural identities, citizens have unique religious and political values, and the populace spans the socio\u2013economic spectrum. Moreover, heterogenous climates and population densities confer different health needs and challenges across the U.S. Thus, critics of universal healthcare in the U.S. argue that implementation would not be as feasible\u2014organizationally or financially\u2014as other developed nations.\u201d [ 190 ]\nAnd, such a system in the United States would hinder medical innovation and entrepreneurship. \u201cGovernment control is a large driver of America\u2019s health care problems. Bureaucrats can\u2019t revolutionize health care \u2013 only entrepreneurs can. By empowering health care entrepreneurs, we can create an American health care system that is more affordable, accessible, and productive for all,\u201d explains Wayne Winegarden, Senior Fellow in Business and Economics, and Director of the Center for Medical Economics and Innovation at Pacific Research Institute. [ 190 ] [ 191 ]\nCon 2\nUniversal health care would raise costs for the federal government and, in turn, taxpayers.\nMedicare-for-all, a recent universal health care proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), would cost an estimated $30 to $40 trillion over ten years. The cost would be the largest single increase to the federal budget ever. [ 192 ]\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that by 2030 federal health care subsidies will increase by $1.5 to $3.0 trillion. The CBO concludes, \u201cBecause the single-payer options that CBO examined would greatly increase federal subsidies for health care, the government would need to implement new financing mechanisms\u2014such as raising existing taxes or introducing new ones, reducing certain spending, or issuing federal debt. As an example, if the government required employers to make contributions toward the cost of health insurance under a single-payer system that would be similar to their contributions under current law, it would have to impose new taxes.\u201d [ 193 ]\nDespite claims by many, the cost of Medicare for All, or any other universal health care option, could not be financed solely by increased taxes on the wealthy. \u201c[T]axes on the middle class would have to rise in order to pay for it. Those taxes could be imposed directly on workers, indirectly through taxes on employers or consumption, or through a combination of direct or indirect taxes. There is simply not enough available revenue from high earners and businesses to cover the full cost of eliminating premiums, ending all cost-sharing, and expanding coverage to all Americans and for (virtually) all health services,\u201d says the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. [ 195 ]\nAn analysis of the Sanders plan \u201cestimates that the average annual cost of the plan would be approximately $2.5 trillion per year creating an average of over a $1 trillion per year financing shortfall. To fund the program, payroll and income taxes would have to increase from a combined 8.4 percent in the Sanders plan to 20 percent while also retaining all remaining tax increases on capital gains, increased marginal tax rates, the estate tax and eliminating tax expenditures\u2026. Overall, over 70 percent of working privately insured households would pay more under a fully funded single payer plan than they do for health insurance today.\u201d [ 196 ]\nCon 3\nUniversal health care would increase wait times for basic care and make Americans\u2019 health worse.\nThe Congressional Budget Office explains, \u201cA single-payer system with little cost sharing for medical services would lead to increased demand for care in the United States because more people would have health insurance and because those already covered would use more services. The extent to which the supply of care would be adequate to meet that increased demand would depend on various factors, such as the payment rates for providers and any measures taken to increase supply. If coverage was nearly universal, cost sharing was very limited, and the payment rates were reduced compared with current law, the demand for medical care would probably exceed the supply of care\u2013with increased wait times for appointments or elective surgeries, greater wait times at doctors\u2019 offices and other facilities, or the need to travel greater distances to receive medical care. Some demand for care might be unmet.\u201d [ 207 ]\nAs an example of lengthy wait times associated with universal coverage, in 2017 Canadians were on waiting lists for an estimated 1,040,791 procedures, and the median wait time for arthroplastic surgery was 20\u201352 weeks. Similarly, average waiting time for elective hospital-based care in the United Kingdom is 46 days, while some patients wait over a year. Increased wait times in the U.S. would likely occur\u2014at least in the short term\u2014as a result of a steep rise in the number of primary and emergency care visits (due to eliminating the financial barrier to seek care), as well as general wastefulness, inefficiency, and disorganization that is often associated with bureaucratic, government-run agencies. [ 17 ] [ 190 ]\nJoshua W. Axene of Axene Health Partners, LLC \u201cwonder[s] if Americans really could function under a system that is budget based and would likely have increased waiting times. In America we have created a healthcare culture that pays providers predominantly on a Fee for Service basis (FFS) and allows people to get what they want, when they want it and generally from whoever they want. American healthcare culture always wants the best thing available and has a \u2018more is better\u2019 mentality. Under a government sponsored socialized healthcare system, choice would become more limited, timing mandated, and supply and demand would be controlled through the constraints of a healthcare budget\u2026. As much as Americans believe that they are crockpots and can be patient, we are more like microwaves and want things fast and on our own terms. Extended waiting lines will not work in the American system and would decrease the quality of our system as a whole.\u201d [ 206 ]"], "citation_links": ["https://healthcare.procon.org"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_e3068911-e0e5-4e6b-8fbe-eb2d992a3187"}
