Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising queer theory in Queering the Renaissance (1994), comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo's phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism. An example is his joking wish \"To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down.\" Romeo's homoeroticism can also be found in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says \"...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet\", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman."], "citation_links": [], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "AttributedQA", "id": "AttributedQA_70243e18-b088-45b4-bc41-c367ffc8aee2"}

During the Middle Ages, the German language was divided into two main branches: High German and Low German. The High German dialects were spoken in the more mountainous regions of the country and were the linguistic precursors to modern Standard German. Meanwhile, the Lower German dialects were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. The names for Germany in other European languages, such as France and Spain, are derived from the Low German dialects, which were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. For example, the French name for Germany is Allemagne, which derives from the Low German word \"alleman\" meaning \"all people.\" Similarly, the Spanish name Alemania is derived from the Low German word \"allerheiligen,\" which translates to \"all saints.\" In addition to the influence of the Low German dialects on the names for Germany in other European languages, other historical events have also contributed to the varying names. For example, the German Empire, which was founded in 1871, was known as \"Deutsches Reich\" in German and \"The Empire of Germany\" in English. This name was also adopted by other European countries and is still used today, such as in the Spanish name \"Imperio Alem\u00e1n.\" The different names for Germany in European languages are a result of the country's rich cultural and linguistic history.

First, regular running helps to strengthen the heart muscle, which increases its efficiency and allows it to pump more blood with each beat. This means that the heart can effectively deliver the same amount of blood to the body with fewer beats, thus lowering the overall heart rate. Additionally, running can help to improve the body's ability to use oxygen more efficiently, thus reducing the amount of oxygen needed by the heart muscle to contract. This reduces the amount of energy needed to beat and lowers the heart rate. Finally, running may also cause the body to produce hormones such as adrenaline, which can slow the heart rate. This is because adrenaline acts as a signal to the body to prepare for a physical activity, which causes the heart rate to slow in order to conserve energy.

{"question": "How can water boil below 100\u00b0C?", "claim": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions.", "claim_raw_string": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions.", "response": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions. Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by creating a seal that traps the steam generated by the boiling liquid, which increases the pressure inside the pot. This increased pressure causes the boiling point of the liquid to rise. Therefore, with a pressure cooker, it is possible to boil water at temperatures as low as 95\u00b0C. In conclusion, water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions, such as in a higher altitude area, a vacuum chamber, or with the use of a pressure cooker.", "references": ["Title: How can water turn to vapor below the boiling point? - The Straight Dope (www.straightdope.com)\nText: What we perceive as temperature is an average effect.

During the Middle Ages, the German language was divided into two main branches: High German and Low German. The High German dialects were spoken in the more mountainous regions of the country and were the linguistic precursors to modern Standard German. Meanwhile, the Lower German dialects were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. The names for Germany in other European languages, such as France and Spain, are derived from the Low German dialects, which were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. For example, the French name for Germany is Allemagne, which derives from the Low German word \"alleman\" meaning \"all people.\" Similarly, the Spanish name Alemania is derived from the Low German word \"allerheiligen,\" which translates to \"all saints.\" In addition to the influence of the Low German dialects on the names for Germany in other European languages, other historical events have also contributed to the varying names. For example, the German Empire, which was founded in 1871, was known as \"Deutsches Reich\" in German and \"The Empire of Germany\" in English. This name was also adopted by other European countries and is still used today, such as in the Spanish name \"Imperio Alem\u00e1n.\" The different names for Germany in European languages are a result of the country's rich cultural and linguistic history. The influence of the Low German dialects, combined with other historical events, has led to a variety of names for Germany across Europe.", "references": ["Title: Why Are There Different Names for the Same Country? | Mental Floss (www.mentalfloss.com)\nText: Some place names simply come from the people who inhabit the land.

{"question": "How can water boil below 100\u00b0C?", "claim": "For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C.", "claim_raw_string": "For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C.", "response": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions. Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by creating a seal that traps the steam generated by the boiling liquid, which increases the pressure inside the pot. This increased pressure causes the boiling point of the liquid to rise. Therefore, with a pressure cooker, it is possible to boil water at temperatures as low as 95\u00b0C.

{"question": "How can water boil below 100\u00b0C?", "claim": "Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure.", "claim_raw_string": "Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure.", "response": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions. Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by creating a seal that traps the steam generated by the boiling liquid, which increases the pressure inside the pot. This increased pressure causes the boiling point of the liquid to rise. Therefore, with a pressure cooker, it is possible to boil water at temperatures as low as 95\u00b0C.

{"question": "How can water boil below 100\u00b0C?", "claim": "When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced.", "claim_raw_string": "When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced.", "response": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions. Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by creating a seal that traps the steam generated by the boiling liquid, which increases the pressure inside the pot. This increased pressure causes the boiling point of the liquid to rise. Therefore, with a pressure cooker, it is possible to boil water at temperatures as low as 95\u00b0C.

First, regular running helps to strengthen the heart muscle, which increases its efficiency and allows it to pump more blood with each beat. This means that the heart can effectively deliver the same amount of blood to the body with fewer beats, thus lowering the overall heart rate. Additionally, running can help to improve the body's ability to use oxygen more efficiently, thus reducing the amount of oxygen needed by the heart muscle to contract. This reduces the amount of energy needed to beat and lowers the heart rate. Finally, running may also cause the body to produce hormones such as adrenaline, which can slow the heart rate. This is because adrenaline acts as a signal to the body to prepare for a physical activity, which causes the heart rate to slow in order to conserve energy. Overall, the combination of these factors makes the heart rate of a regular runner lower than that of a non-runner. Regular running not only strengthens the heart muscle, but it also improves the body's ability to use oxygen more efficiently and can cause the release of hormones that slow the heart rate.", "references": ["Title: Runners and low heart rate (www.runnersworld.com)\nText: A heart rate of less than 60 is called a bradycardia, or slow heart rate. It is not unusual for healthy people involved in endurance activities to develop a bradycardia based on the increased vagal tone from training that suppresses heart rate. Training also increases the heart size so it can push out a greater volume of blood to the body with each contraction.\n\n\nA lower heart rate will deliver the same blood volume in a trained resting heart as the higher heart rate in an untrained heart.

{"question": "How can water boil below 100\u00b0C?", "claim": "A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum.", "claim_raw_string": "A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum.", "response": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions. Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by creating a seal that traps the steam generated by the boiling liquid, which increases the pressure inside the pot. This increased pressure causes the boiling point of the liquid to rise. Therefore, with a pressure cooker, it is possible to boil water at temperatures as low as 95\u00b0C. In conclusion, water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions, such as in a higher altitude area, a vacuum chamber, or with the use of a pressure cooker.", "references": ["Title: How can water turn to vapor below the boiling point? - The Straight Dope (www.straightdope.com)\nText: What we perceive as temperature is an average effect.

During the Middle Ages, the German language was divided into two main branches: High German and Low German. The High German dialects were spoken in the more mountainous regions of the country and were the linguistic precursors to modern Standard German. Meanwhile, the Lower German dialects were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. The names for Germany in other European languages, such as France and Spain, are derived from the Low German dialects, which were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. For example, the French name for Germany is Allemagne, which derives from the Low German word \"alleman\" meaning \"all people.\" Similarly, the Spanish name Alemania is derived from the Low German word \"allerheiligen,\" which translates to \"all saints.\" In addition to the influence of the Low German dialects on the names for Germany in other European languages, other historical events have also contributed to the varying names. For example, the German Empire, which was founded in 1871, was known as \"Deutsches Reich\" in German and \"The Empire of Germany\" in English. This name was also adopted by other European countries and is still used today, such as in the Spanish name \"Imperio Alem\u00e1n.\" The different names for Germany in European languages are a result of the country's rich cultural and linguistic history.

{"question": "How can water boil below 100\u00b0C?", "claim": "In conclusion, water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions, such as in a higher altitude area, a vacuum chamber, or with the use of a pressure cooker.", "claim_raw_string": "In conclusion, water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions, such as in a higher altitude area, a vacuum chamber, or with the use of a pressure cooker.", "response": " Water can boil below 100\u00b0C under certain conditions. Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker.

Meanwhile, the Lower German dialects were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. The names for Germany in other European languages, such as France and Spain, are derived from the Low German dialects, which were spoken in the lowland regions and had a greater influence on the languages of neighboring countries. For example, the French name for Germany is Allemagne, which derives from the Low German word \"alleman\" meaning \"all people.\" Similarly, the Spanish name Alemania is derived from the Low German word \"allerheiligen,\" which translates to \"all saints.\" In addition to the influence of the Low German dialects on the names for Germany in other European languages, other historical events have also contributed to the varying names. For example, the German Empire, which was founded in 1871, was known as \"Deutsches Reich\" in German and \"The Empire of Germany\" in English. This name was also adopted by other European countries and is still used today, such as in the Spanish name \"Imperio Alem\u00e1n.\" The different names for Germany in European languages are a result of the country's rich cultural and linguistic history.

Most commonly, this occurs when there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. When atmospheric pressure decreases, the boiling point of a liquid also decreases. This is why water can boil at a lower temperature in higher altitudes, such as in the mountains, where atmospheric pressure is lower. At sea level, water boils at 100\u00b0C, but as the altitude increases, the boiling point of water is lowered. For example, at an altitude of 10,000 feet, water will begin to boil at around 93\u00b0C. So, if you are in a higher altitude area, you can boil water at a temperature below 100\u00b0C. Another way that water can boil below 100\u00b0C is through the use of a vacuum chamber. A vacuum chamber is an enclosed space that has been engineered to create a vacuum. A vacuum is a space with a significantly reduced pressure, usually close to zero. When water is placed in a vacuum chamber, its boiling point is drastically reduced. In fact, water can boil at temperatures as low as 35\u00b0C in a vacuum chamber. This is because, due to the low pressure, the molecules of the liquid need less energy to reach the boiling point. Finally, it is also possible to boil water below 100\u00b0C with the use of a pressure cooker. Pressure cookers work by creating a seal that traps the steam generated by the boiling liquid, which increases the pressure inside the pot.

First, regular running helps to strengthen the heart muscle, which increases its efficiency and allows it to pump more blood with each beat. This means that the heart can effectively deliver the same amount of blood to the body with fewer beats, thus lowering the overall heart rate. Additionally, running can help to improve the body's ability to use oxygen more efficiently, thus reducing the amount of oxygen needed by the heart muscle to contract. This reduces the amount of energy needed to beat and lowers the heart rate. Finally, running may also cause the body to produce hormones such as adrenaline, which can slow the heart rate. This is because adrenaline acts as a signal to the body to prepare for a physical activity, which causes the heart rate to slow in order to conserve energy. Overall, the combination of these factors makes the heart rate of a regular runner lower than that of a non-runner. Regular running not only strengthens the heart muscle, but it also improves the body's ability to use oxygen more efficiently and can cause the release of hormones that slow the heart rate.", "references": ["Title: Runners and low heart rate (www.runnersworld.com)\nText: A heart rate of less than 60 is called a bradycardia, or slow heart rate.

Frequency and repetition: The Usage-Based approach emphasizes the importance of frequency and repetition in shaping linguistic structures, suggesting that repeated exposure to language patterns leads to the entrenchment of these patterns in our linguistic knowledge[3]. Construction Grammar: A crucial aspect of the Usage-Based approach is the idea of construction grammar, which posits that the form and meaning of linguistic items are not separate, but inherently linked in constructions that range from morphemes to complex phrases and sentences[4]. Schemas and analogy: The Usage-Based approach asserts that speakers abstract generalizations from their previous language experiences in the form of schemas, which are then used to process new linguistic input and generate novel expressions through the process of analogy[5]. Emergentism: Central to the Usage-Based approach is the idea of emergentism, which posits that linguistic structures and categories arise from the interaction of cognitive, social, and communicative factors in an individual's language use[6]. Cognitive factors: The Usage-Based approach emphasizes the role of general cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, in shaping linguistic knowledge and behavior[7]. Social and contextual factors: Additionally, the Usage-Based approach highlights the influence of social and contextual factors in language acquisition and usage, suggesting that language is closely tied to human interaction and social cognition[8].", "references": ["[3] https://brill.com/view/journals/jlc/13/3/article-p459_459.xml?language=en\n\nAbstract The influence of usage frequency, and particularly of linguistic similarity on human linguistic behavior and linguistic change in situations of language contact are well documented in contact linguistics literature.

Simulation: Run simulations on your design using a testbench to emulate real-world operating conditions and ensure that the design meets the desired functionality and performance specifications [2]. Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5].

In-system debugging: Use in-system debugging tools such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, or built-in FPGA debugging features to monitor the functionality of your design in the target FPGA device [11]. This can help identify errors related to signal integrity, power supply, or unexpected behavior during actual operation[12].

Reaction mechanism: Step-growth polymerization, also known as condensation polymerization, proceeds through the reaction between functional groups of monomers to form larger molecules, with each step contributing to the length of the polymer chain [2]. In chain-growth polymerization, also known as addition or chain reaction polymerization, a reactive species (initiator) reacts with a monomer to create a reactive site that continues to add on monomer units to form a long polymer chain [3]. Required monomers: Step-growth polymerization requires bifunctional or polyfunctional monomers (monomers with two or more reactive groups) [4]. Chain-growth polymerization typically involves monomers with a carbon-carbon double bond (unsaturated monomers) [5]. Active centers: In step-growth polymerization, the reactive species are present at the ends of growing polymer chains, and there are no persistent reactive centers [6]. In chain-growth polymerization, the active, reactive center propagates throughout the entire polymerization process, terminating only when the polymer chain reaches its final length [7]. Molecular weight distribution: Step-growth polymerization usually results in a wide molecular weight distribution, as the chains grow in a stepwise manner [8].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9].

Pregnant adolescents are at higher risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and prenatal mortality [2]. They may also experience increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of social isolation due to societal attitudes and a lack of support [3]. Unsupervised adolescent pregnancies are often associated with lower educational attainment and greater likelihood of dropping out of school, which can limit future employment and earning potential  [4]. Additionally, becoming a parent at a young age may lead to the cycle of poverty, as young parents may lack the financial and social resources required to raise a child adequately [5]. Moreover, studies suggest that adolescent parents may be less capable of providing appropriate care and stimulation for their children, which may negatively affect the child's cognitive development and educational outcomes [6]. Furthermore, adolescent pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for mental health issues, including postpartum depression, anxiety disorders, and other psychological conditions [7]. The challenges of parenting during adolescence, coupled with the stigma and discrimination often faced by young parents, can exacerbate existing mental health issues and increase the risk of developing new ones [8].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9].

One possibility is that without Charles II's return, the English Commonwealth and Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell might have continued for a longer duration [3]. Another scenario could be the eventual restoration of the monarchy under another Stuart or a different royal line, given the strong historical precedent for monarchy in Britain and the political instability during the interregnum [4]. It is also important to consider that Charles II was invited to return to England by the Convention Parliament as a means of restoring stability and order to the country following the collapse of Richard Cromwell's government [5]. If Charles II had not returned, it is possible that England would've faced ongoing political turmoil, leading the Convention Parliament or subsequent governments to seek alternative means of resolving the crisis[6].

While some researchers argue that punishment can be an effective method to reduce undesirable behavior , others point to potential ethical concerns and the long-term consequences of using punishment when working with vulnerable individuals, such as children, elderly, or individuals with disabilities  [2]. One major concern with using punishment procedures is that they can result in negative psychological outcomes for vulnerable individuals, such as increased anxiety, anger, or fear [3]. Additionally, the use of physical punishment can lead to physical harm and is considered inappropriate in most professional settings [4]. An alternative to punishment procedures is the use of positive reinforcement strategies, which involve rewarding and reinforcing desired behaviors rather than punishing undesired ones [5]. This approach can be more effective in promoting long-term behavior change and has been shown to be more conducive to the development of a therapeutic alliance with vulnerable individuals [6]. When considering the use of punishment procedures with vulnerable populations, it is essential to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks and ethical concerns [7]. This may involve consulting with colleagues or using established ethical guidelines to inform decision-making [8].

Positive reinforcement involves adding something that is desired or rewarding that increases the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated. For example, giving dessert for finishing all of their dinner. Negative reinforcement is the removal of something that is aversive or undesired in order to increase the desired behavior. For example, when you put your seat belt on in the car, it stops beeping at you. Alternatively, punishment is used to decrease an undesired or inappropriate behavior. For example, time out for hitting, or getting a ticket for speeding.\n\nResearch shows that reinforcement tends to be more effective in modifying behavior. Why is that? While both punishment and reinforcement help to modify behavior, they do this differently.

Quadrature Encoder: This is the main input device that generates two square wave signals, known as channels A and B, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other[2]. These signals are used to determine the rotation direction and speed of the motor shaft [3]. Signal Conditioning: A signal conditioning circuit is required to ensure that the signals from the quadrature encoder are compatible with the input levels required by the PIC microcontroller[4]. This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10]. Output Interface: The microcontroller can then provide the calculated speed and direction information to an external device, such as a display, data logger, or control system, using various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, or I2C [11].

Reaction mechanism: Step-growth polymerization, also known as condensation polymerization, proceeds through the reaction between functional groups of monomers to form larger molecules, with each step contributing to the length of the polymer chain [2]. In chain-growth polymerization, also known as addition or chain reaction polymerization, a reactive species (initiator) reacts with a monomer to create a reactive site that continues to add on monomer units to form a long polymer chain [3]. Required monomers: Step-growth polymerization requires bifunctional or polyfunctional monomers (monomers with two or more reactive groups) [4]. Chain-growth polymerization typically involves monomers with a carbon-carbon double bond (unsaturated monomers) [5]. Active centers: In step-growth polymerization, the reactive species are present at the ends of growing polymer chains, and there are no persistent reactive centers [6]. In chain-growth polymerization, the active, reactive center propagates throughout the entire polymerization process, terminating only when the polymer chain reaches its final length [7]. Molecular weight distribution: Step-growth polymerization usually results in a wide molecular weight distribution, as the chains grow in a stepwise manner [8].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9]. Its incorporation into hybrid density functional theory methods allows for more accurate predictions of molecular properties and reaction energies, making it a critical component for chemists working in the computational field[10].", "references": ["[4] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17144681?dopt=Abstract\n\nMany-electron self-interaction error in approximate density functionals. - PubMed - NCBI J Chem Phys. 2006 Nov 28;125(20):201102.

First, you can perform protein mutagenic and structural analysis studies, along with homology database searches, to identify microorganisms that potentially possess biodegradation genes [1]. Mining molecular databases for plastic degradation-conferring genes (PDGs) can help identify potential candidates [2].\n\nAnother approach is to use heterologous expression of microbiome-derived candidate genes in a host that lacks degradation capacity in the absence of the introduced gene [2]. This method can verify PDGs experimentally and has been utilized to confirm plastic degradation-conferring phenotypes of PDGs encoding putative PHB-depolymerases, esterases, cutinases, carboxylesterase, and PET hydrolases from various bacteria and fungi [2]. Overexpression in heterologous hosts also serves as a valuable tool for purifying high levels of enzymes for in vitro assays or studying enzyme crystal structures [2].\n\nAlternatively, you can disrupt or silence the candidate PDGs in the microorganism that possesses biodegradation ability, to evaluate the impact of gene disruption or silencing on their biodegradation potential [2].

Social and contextual factors: Additionally, the Usage-Based approach highlights the influence of social and contextual factors in language acquisition and usage, suggesting that language is closely tied to human interaction and social cognition[8].", "references": ["[5] https://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-363?rskey=UMXXcW&result=5\n\nlinguistics, analogy is often used as a descriptive term for a certain type of structural change, notably morphological change (Trask, 1996, pp. 105\u2013115), but in usage-based linguistics, analogy is a domain-general cognitive phenomenon that accounts for the productive use of language (Bybee & Moder, 1983; Bar\u00f0dal, 2008) as well as certain types of language change (Bybee, 2010, \u00a74) and language acquisition (Diessel, 2013). Traditionally, linguistic productivity is explained by algorithmic rules (Pinker, 1999); but in the usage-based approach, the traditional notion of a linguistic rule has been replaced by the notion of construction or schema (Bybee, 1995; Langacker, 2000). As pointed out in section 2, (constructional) schemas are abstract grammatical patterns that emerge as generalizations over complex words and utterances with overlapping properties.

Early adverse experiences, such as trauma, abuse, neglect, and the loss of a parent, have been linked to an increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health problems in both childhood and adulthood  [2]. In addition to traumatic events, the quality of attachment between a child and their primary caregiver is considered crucial in determining future mental health [3]. Secure attachment can act as a protective factor, whereas insecure attachment styles (e.g., anxious or avoidant attachment) may contribute to the emergence of psychopathology [4]. Furthermore, parenting styles and family environment can also impact the development of psychopathology[5]. Authoritative parenting, characterized by warmth, support, and consistent discipline, has been associated with lower risk of psychopathology, while authoritarian and permissive parenting styles may contribute to an increased risk  [6]. Additionally, living in a chaotic or high-conflict family environment can heighten the risk of mental health disorders in children [7]. It is important to note that childhood experiences are not the sole determinants of psychopathology; genetic predisposition, biological factors, and social support are essential considerations[8].

Once the indole compound is obtained, a tetrazole precursor, an alkyne with an azide group, can be introduced at the C3 position using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) [4]. This reaction, also known as click chemistry, results in the formation of a 1,2,3-triazole ring, which can then be converted to a tetrazole ring using a reagent such as tributyltin azide [5]. Palladium-Catalyzed Direct C-H Bond Functionalization:\nAnother synthetic route for the formation of indole compounds functionalized with a tetrazole ring at the C3 position is through direct C-H bond functionalization using palladium catalysis [6].

Basic Guidelines on Approaching Victims of Crime Background The way people cope as victims of crime depends largely on their experiences immediately following the crime. As a law enforcement officer, you are usually the first official to approach victims. For this reason, you are in a unique position to help victims cope with the immediate trauma of the crime and to help restore their sense of security and control over their lives. Circumstances of the crime and the crime scene determine when and how the first responding officers are able to address victims and their needs. This publication recognizes that each crime and crime scene is different and requires officers to prioritize their performance of tasks in each situation.

It is helpful to keep in mind that apprehension of the suspect is the primary duty of law enforcement and that accomplishing this task helps not only the suspects current victims but potential victims as well. Sometimes the first responders must delay their attendance to the victims if the situation requires. For example, if the crime is ongoing, or if the collection of evidence or investigation of the crime is extremely time-sensitive, first responders may not be able to direct their immediate attention to the victims. However, as soon as the most urgent and pressing tasks have been addressed, officers will focus their attention on the victims and their needs. At this point, how the officers respond to the victims, explain the competing law enforcement duties, and work with the victims is very important.

Some key assessment for learning strategies include:\n\n1. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): These are open-ended questions with several possible answers, from which students must select one correct response. MCQs are useful for daily assessment strategies [1].\n\n2. Questioning: There are two main types of questions - closed and open. Closed questions require short, factual answers, while open questions encourage students to expand on their knowledge and understanding. To improve the quality of answers, educators should increase the 'wait time' to three seconds after asking a question, allowing students sufficient time to process and articulate their thoughts [2].\n\n3. Feedback: Providing feedback to learners helps them identify their strengths and weaknesses, which can be used as a basis for improving their performance [3].\n\n4. Self-assessment: Encouraging students to reflect on their own learning and understanding can be a valuable aspect of assessment for learning [4].\n\n5. Peer-assessment: Allowing students to assess their peers' work can also be an effective strategy to support learning and develop critical evaluation skills [4].\n\n6. Direct observation: Observing and monitoring students directly in the classroom can provide important insights into their understanding of the subject matter and help identify misconceptions [4].\n\n7. Formative use of summative assessment: Incorporating formative assessments, such as quizzes and practice exams, can help teachers refine their teaching approaches and identify areas that need further reinforcement or clarification [4].\n\nUtilizing a combination of these assessment for learning strategies helps create a learner-centered classroom with a supportive atmosphere, where students are not afraid to make mistakes and learn from them [2].

Pregnant adolescents are at higher risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and prenatal mortality [2]. They may also experience increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of social isolation due to societal attitudes and a lack of support [3]. Unsupervised adolescent pregnancies are often associated with lower educational attainment and greater likelihood of dropping out of school, which can limit future employment and earning potential  [4]. Additionally, becoming a parent at a young age may lead to the cycle of poverty, as young parents may lack the financial and social resources required to raise a child adequately [5]. Moreover, studies suggest that adolescent parents may be less capable of providing appropriate care and stimulation for their children, which may negatively affect the child's cognitive development and educational outcomes [6]. Furthermore, adolescent pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for mental health issues, including postpartum depression, anxiety disorders, and other psychological conditions [7]. The challenges of parenting during adolescence, coupled with the stigma and discrimination often faced by young parents, can exacerbate existing mental health issues and increase the risk of developing new ones [8]. In conclusion, an unsupervised pregnancy during adolescence can have wide-ranging consequences for both the young persons and their children, affecting their mental health, education, and long-term socioeconomic prospects[9].

In chain-growth polymerization, also known as addition or chain reaction polymerization, a reactive species (initiator) reacts with a monomer to create a reactive site that continues to add on monomer units to form a long polymer chain [3]. Required monomers: Step-growth polymerization requires bifunctional or polyfunctional monomers (monomers with two or more reactive groups) [4].

Active centers: In step-growth polymerization, the reactive species are present at the ends of growing polymer chains, and there are no persistent reactive centers [6]. In chain-growth polymerization, the active, reactive center propagates throughout the entire polymerization process, terminating only when the polymer chain reaches its final length [7]. Molecular weight distribution: Step-growth polymerization usually results in a wide molecular weight distribution, as the chains grow in a stepwise manner [8].

While some researchers argue that punishment can be an effective method to reduce undesirable behavior , others point to potential ethical concerns and the long-term consequences of using punishment when working with vulnerable individuals, such as children, elderly, or individuals with disabilities  [2]. One major concern with using punishment procedures is that they can result in negative psychological outcomes for vulnerable individuals, such as increased anxiety, anger, or fear [3]. Additionally, the use of physical punishment can lead to physical harm and is considered inappropriate in most professional settings [4]. An alternative to punishment procedures is the use of positive reinforcement strategies, which involve rewarding and reinforcing desired behaviors rather than punishing undesired ones [5]. This approach can be more effective in promoting long-term behavior change and has been shown to be more conducive to the development of a therapeutic alliance with vulnerable individuals [6]. When considering the use of punishment procedures with vulnerable populations, it is essential to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks and ethical concerns [7].

Some key assessment for learning strategies include:\n\n1. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs): These are open-ended questions with several possible answers, from which students must select one correct response. MCQs are useful for daily assessment strategies [1].\n\n2. Questioning: There are two main types of questions - closed and open. Closed questions require short, factual answers, while open questions encourage students to expand on their knowledge and understanding. To improve the quality of answers, educators should increase the 'wait time' to three seconds after asking a question, allowing students sufficient time to process and articulate their thoughts [2].\n\n3. Feedback: Providing feedback to learners helps them identify their strengths and weaknesses, which can be used as a basis for improving their performance [3].\n\n4. Self-assessment: Encouraging students to reflect on their own learning and understanding can be a valuable aspect of assessment for learning [4].\n\n5. Peer-assessment: Allowing students to assess their peers' work can also be an effective strategy to support learning and develop critical evaluation skills [4].\n\n6. Direct observation: Observing and monitoring students directly in the classroom can provide important insights into their understanding of the subject matter and help identify misconceptions [4].\n\n7. Formative use of summative assessment: Incorporating formative assessments, such as quizzes and practice exams, can help teachers refine their teaching approaches and identify areas that need further reinforcement or clarification [4].\n\nUtilizing a combination of these assessment for learning strategies helps create a learner-centered classroom with a supportive atmosphere, where students are not afraid to make mistakes and learn from them [2].

Language as a dynamic system: Usage-Based approach posits that language is a constantly changing and adapting system based on the social interactions and experiences of its users[2]. Frequency and repetition: The Usage-Based approach emphasizes the importance of frequency and repetition in shaping linguistic structures, suggesting that repeated exposure to language patterns leads to the entrenchment of these patterns in our linguistic knowledge[3]. Construction Grammar: A crucial aspect of the Usage-Based approach is the idea of construction grammar, which posits that the form and meaning of linguistic items are not separate, but inherently linked in constructions that range from morphemes to complex phrases and sentences[4]. Schemas and analogy: The Usage-Based approach asserts that speakers abstract generalizations from their previous language experiences in the form of schemas, which are then used to process new linguistic input and generate novel expressions through the process of analogy[5]. Emergentism: Central to the Usage-Based approach is the idea of emergentism, which posits that linguistic structures and categories arise from the interaction of cognitive, social, and communicative factors in an individual's language use[6]. Cognitive factors: The Usage-Based approach emphasizes the role of general cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, in shaping linguistic knowledge and behavior[7].

Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5].

Language as a dynamic system: Usage-Based approach posits that language is a constantly changing and adapting system based on the social interactions and experiences of its users[2]. Frequency and repetition: The Usage-Based approach emphasizes the importance of frequency and repetition in shaping linguistic structures, suggesting that repeated exposure to language patterns leads to the entrenchment of these patterns in our linguistic knowledge[3]. Construction Grammar: A crucial aspect of the Usage-Based approach is the idea of construction grammar, which posits that the form and meaning of linguistic items are not separate, but inherently linked in constructions that range from morphemes to complex phrases and sentences[4]. Schemas and analogy: The Usage-Based approach asserts that speakers abstract generalizations from their previous language experiences in the form of schemas, which are then used to process new linguistic input and generate novel expressions through the process of analogy[5]. Emergentism: Central to the Usage-Based approach is the idea of emergentism, which posits that linguistic structures and categories arise from the interaction of cognitive, social, and communicative factors in an individual's language use[6]. Cognitive factors: The Usage-Based approach emphasizes the role of general cognitive processes, such as attention and memory, in shaping linguistic knowledge and behavior[7].

Pregnant adolescents are at higher risk for complications during pregnancy and childbirth, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and prenatal mortality [2]. They may also experience increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of social isolation due to societal attitudes and a lack of support [3]. Unsupervised adolescent pregnancies are often associated with lower educational attainment and greater likelihood of dropping out of school, which can limit future employment and earning potential  [4]. Additionally, becoming a parent at a young age may lead to the cycle of poverty, as young parents may lack the financial and social resources required to raise a child adequately [5]. Moreover, studies suggest that adolescent parents may be less capable of providing appropriate care and stimulation for their children, which may negatively affect the child's cognitive development and educational outcomes [6]. Furthermore, adolescent pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for mental health issues, including postpartum depression, anxiety disorders, and other psychological conditions [7]. The challenges of parenting during adolescence, coupled with the stigma and discrimination often faced by young parents, can exacerbate existing mental health issues and increase the risk of developing new ones [8]. In conclusion, an unsupervised pregnancy during adolescence can have wide-ranging consequences for both the young persons and their children, affecting their mental health, education, and long-term socioeconomic prospects[9].

Additionally, they might not be aware that cognitive empathy, or the intellectual understanding of feelings, may be diminished in some autistic individuals, while affective empathy, or the emotional response to another's feelings, may still be present [5].

Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5]. These tools may report errors or warnings related to issues like timing violations or insufficient resources to implement the design [6]. Static Timing Analysis (STA): Perform STA to ensure that the design meets the timing requirements of the target FPGA[7]. STA can identify timing violations and report errors related to setup and hold times, clock-to-Q delays, and other timing constraints [8]. Bitstream generation: Create a bitstream file for programming the FPGA[9]. The bitstream generation process may report errors related to resource over-utilization or unmet constraints [10].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9]. Its incorporation into hybrid density functional theory methods allows for more accurate predictions of molecular properties and reaction energies, making it a critical component for chemists working in the computational field[10].", "references": ["[2] https://chemistry.unimelb.edu.au/news/successful-papers-on-density-functional-theory\n\nSuccessful Papers on Density Functional Theory Successful Papers on Density Functional Theory Congratulations to the Goerigk group who published a front-cover article in Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics (PCCP), which also got selected for PCCP\u2019s themed collection of \u201c2018 hot articles\u201d [1].

An emergency protection order allows an authorized person to remove a child from their current environment or prevent their removal from a safe place if there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm if they remain in or are removed from that place [2]. In this case, if social services have evidence suggesting that the parent is gaining sexual gratification from seeing his infant daughter, the risk of emotional and psychological harm to the child may be considered significant, particularly if the parent's behavior escalates or if the child becomes aware of the situation as she grows older  [3]. However, determining whether grounds for a section 34.4 order are met depends on several factors, including the strength of the evidence, the likelihood of the child being exposed to further harm, and whether supervised contact is sufficient to protect the child from harm  [4]. Given that the child is currently in foster care and contact with the parent is supervised, the situation may already be providing some level of protection for the child[5]. However, if the evidence is strong enough and suggests that the risk of significant harm is still present, social services may consider pursuing an emergency protection order to ensure the child's safety  [6].

Quadrature Encoder: This is the main input device that generates two square wave signals, known as channels A and B, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other[2]. These signals are used to determine the rotation direction and speed of the motor shaft [3]. Signal Conditioning: A signal conditioning circuit is required to ensure that the signals from the quadrature encoder are compatible with the input levels required by the PIC microcontroller[4]. This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10].

To calculate the fuel depletion time for a PWR with a fuel enrichment of 35%, you would need to know the specific values of these factors and use them in the appropriate equations[2]. One common parameter used to measure fuel depletion is the burnup rate, which represents the amount of energy extracted from a unit mass of nuclear fuel and is typically expressed in gigawatt-days per metric ton of uranium (GWd/MTU) [3]. The burnup rate depends on factors such as fuel composition, reactor design, and operating conditions [4].

Quadrature Encoder: This is the main input device that generates two square wave signals, known as channels A and B, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other[2]. These signals are used to determine the rotation direction and speed of the motor shaft [3]. Signal Conditioning: A signal conditioning circuit is required to ensure that the signals from the quadrature encoder are compatible with the input levels required by the PIC microcontroller[4]. This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10]. Output Interface: The microcontroller can then provide the calculated speed and direction information to an external device, such as a display, data logger, or control system, using various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, or I2C [11].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9].

Simulation: Run simulations on your design using a testbench to emulate real-world operating conditions and ensure that the design meets the desired functionality and performance specifications [2]. Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5]. These tools may report errors or warnings related to issues like timing violations or insufficient resources to implement the design [6]. Static Timing Analysis (STA): Perform STA to ensure that the design meets the timing requirements of the target FPGA[7]. STA can identify timing violations and report errors related to setup and hold times, clock-to-Q delays, and other timing constraints [8]. Bitstream generation: Create a bitstream file for programming the FPGA[9]. The bitstream generation process may report errors related to resource over-utilization or unmet constraints [10]. In-system debugging: Use in-system debugging tools such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, or built-in FPGA debugging features to monitor the functionality of your design in the target FPGA device [11].

Age and gender play a role in determining the dose equivalent because the radiosensitivity of the body and the risk of developing radiation-related health effects, such as cancer, vary with age and between genders [4]. For instance, younger individuals are generally more sensitive to radiation exposure than older individuals due to their higher rate of cell division and longer remaining lifespan to develop potential cancer or other radiation-related effects [5]. Similarly, gender differences exist, with women showing a higher risk of developing certain radiation-induced cancers, such as breast cancer, compared to men [6].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9]. Its incorporation into hybrid density functional theory methods allows for more accurate predictions of molecular properties and reaction energies, making it a critical component for chemists working in the computational field[10].", "references": ["[6] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-019-0160-9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=2f819366-6e2a-48a1-8cc7-1aaaa98f9f7e\n\nDesigning interfaces in energy materials applications with first-principles calculations | npj Computational Materials caution is warranted as the selection of computational parameters, in particular the treatment of the exchange and correlation functional in DFT, can provide significantly different results while simulating interfaces.

Fischer Indole Synthesis followed by Copper-Catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloaddition (CuAAC):\nFischer indole synthesis involves reacting phenylhydrazine with an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions, resulting in the formation of an indole ring [3]. Once the indole compound is obtained, a tetrazole precursor, an alkyne with an azide group, can be introduced at the C3 position using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) [4]. This reaction, also known as click chemistry, results in the formation of a 1,2,3-triazole ring, which can then be converted to a tetrazole ring using a reagent such as tributyltin azide [5]. Palladium-Catalyzed Direct C-H Bond Functionalization:\nAnother synthetic route for the formation of indole compounds functionalized with a tetrazole ring at the C3 position is through direct C-H bond functionalization using palladium catalysis [6]. In this method, a pre-formed indole compound undergoes a direct C-H bond arylation or alkylation at the C3 position using a palladium catalyst in the presence of an appropriate tetrazole coupling partner [7]. This approach allows for the efficient introduction of various functional groups at the C3 position, including tetrazole rings[8].

An emergency protection order allows an authorized person to remove a child from their current environment or prevent their removal from a safe place if there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm if they remain in or are removed from that place [2]. In this case, if social services have evidence suggesting that the parent is gaining sexual gratification from seeing his infant daughter, the risk of emotional and psychological harm to the child may be considered significant, particularly if the parent's behavior escalates or if the child becomes aware of the situation as she grows older  [3]. However, determining whether grounds for a section 34.4 order are met depends on several factors, including the strength of the evidence, the likelihood of the child being exposed to further harm, and whether supervised contact is sufficient to protect the child from harm  [4].

Exact exchange is an essential component of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) methods, which are widely used in computational chemistry for their balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [2]. By incorporating exact exchange, these methods provide a more accurate representation of electron correlation, leading to improved predictions of molecular properties such as geometries, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energies  [3]. Precisely, the inclusion of exact exchange in DFT approaches helps to address the self-interaction error (SIE) that occurs when an electron interacts with its own charge distribution [4]. The SIE is a significant limitation in traditional DFT methods and can lead to overestimation of energy values or incorrect descriptions of molecular systems [5]. By including exact exchange, hybrid DFT methods significantly reduce the SIE, thereby enhancing the accuracy of computational predictions [6]. Additionally, the description of long-range electron interactions can be effectively improved by including exact exchange terms [7]. This leads to a better description of weak intermolecular interactions, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, which are important in the study of many molecular systems and processes, including protein-ligand interactions, supramolecular chemistry, and crystal structures  [8]. In summary, exact exchange is essential in computational chemistry because it improves the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical calculations by addressing the self-interaction error and enhancing the description of long-range electron interactions [9]. Its incorporation into hybrid density functional theory methods allows for more accurate predictions of molecular properties and reaction energies, making it a critical component for chemists working in the computational field[10].", "references": ["[8] https://redefininghomeopathy.com/2015/12/11/potentization-a-phenomenon-belonging-to-the-domain-of-supra-molecular-chemistry/\n\n\u2018Potentization\u2019- A Phenomenon Belonging To The Domain Of Supra-molecular Chemistry | REDEFINING HOMEOPATHY are directed to assemble through non-covalent interactions.

Simulation: Run simulations on your design using a testbench to emulate real-world operating conditions and ensure that the design meets the desired functionality and performance specifications [2]. Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5]. These tools may report errors or warnings related to issues like timing violations or insufficient resources to implement the design [6]. Static Timing Analysis (STA): Perform STA to ensure that the design meets the timing requirements of the target FPGA[7]. STA can identify timing violations and report errors related to setup and hold times, clock-to-Q delays, and other timing constraints [8]. Bitstream generation: Create a bitstream file for programming the FPGA[9]. The bitstream generation process may report errors related to resource over-utilization or unmet constraints [10]. In-system debugging: Use in-system debugging tools such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, or built-in FPGA debugging features to monitor the functionality of your design in the target FPGA device [11]. This can help identify errors related to signal integrity, power supply, or unexpected behavior during actual operation[12]. Design verification: Implement verification techniques like formal verification, assertion-based verification, or code coverage analysis to validate the correctness of your design [13].

The dose equivalent, or effective dose, accounts for the varying sensitivities of different tissues and organs to radiation [2]. It is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by a radiation weighting factor (for the type of radiation) and a tissue weighting factor (for the specific organ or tissue being irradiated) [3]. Age and gender play a role in determining the dose equivalent because the radiosensitivity of the body and the risk of developing radiation-related health effects, such as cancer, vary with age and between genders [4]. For instance, younger individuals are generally more sensitive to radiation exposure than older individuals due to their higher rate of cell division and longer remaining lifespan to develop potential cancer or other radiation-related effects [5]. Similarly, gender differences exist, with women showing a higher risk of developing certain radiation-induced cancers, such as breast cancer, compared to men [6]. These differences in radiosensitivity and risk are taken into account when determining dose equivalent limits for radiation protection standards, with lower dose limits suggested for younger people and female workers to minimize the risk of radiation-related health issues [7].", "references": ["[1] http://www.solarstorms.org/FAAAirlines.html\n\nRadiation Exposure of Air Carrier Crewmembers - FAA AC 120-52 atoms).

Quadrature Encoder: This is the main input device that generates two square wave signals, known as channels A and B, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other[2]. These signals are used to determine the rotation direction and speed of the motor shaft [3]. Signal Conditioning: A signal conditioning circuit is required to ensure that the signals from the quadrature encoder are compatible with the input levels required by the PIC microcontroller[4]. This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10]. Output Interface: The microcontroller can then provide the calculated speed and direction information to an external device, such as a display, data logger, or control system, using various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, or I2C [11].

Quadrature Encoder: This is the main input device that generates two square wave signals, known as channels A and B, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other[2]. These signals are used to determine the rotation direction and speed of the motor shaft [3]. Signal Conditioning: A signal conditioning circuit is required to ensure that the signals from the quadrature encoder are compatible with the input levels required by the PIC microcontroller[4]. This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10]. Output Interface: The microcontroller can then provide the calculated speed and direction information to an external device, such as a display, data logger, or control system, using various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, or I2C [11].

An emergency protection order allows an authorized person to remove a child from their current environment or prevent their removal from a safe place if there is reasonable cause to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm if they remain in or are removed from that place [2]. In this case, if social services have evidence suggesting that the parent is gaining sexual gratification from seeing his infant daughter, the risk of emotional and psychological harm to the child may be considered significant, particularly if the parent's behavior escalates or if the child becomes aware of the situation as she grows older  [3]. However, determining whether grounds for a section 34.4 order are met depends on several factors, including the strength of the evidence, the likelihood of the child being exposed to further harm, and whether supervised contact is sufficient to protect the child from harm  [4]. Given that the child is currently in foster care and contact with the parent is supervised, the situation may already be providing some level of protection for the child[5]. However, if the evidence is strong enough and suggests that the risk of significant harm is still present, social services may consider pursuing an emergency protection order to ensure the child's safety  [6].

Quadrature Encoder: This is the main input device that generates two square wave signals, known as channels A and B, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other[2]. These signals are used to determine the rotation direction and speed of the motor shaft [3]. Signal Conditioning: A signal conditioning circuit is required to ensure that the signals from the quadrature encoder are compatible with the input levels required by the PIC microcontroller[4]. This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10]. Output Interface: The microcontroller can then provide the calculated speed and direction information to an external device, such as a display, data logger, or control system, using various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, or I2C [11].

Simulation: Run simulations on your design using a testbench to emulate real-world operating conditions and ensure that the design meets the desired functionality and performance specifications [2]. Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5]. These tools may report errors or warnings related to issues like timing violations or insufficient resources to implement the design [6]. Static Timing Analysis (STA): Perform STA to ensure that the design meets the timing requirements of the target FPGA[7]. STA can identify timing violations and report errors related to setup and hold times, clock-to-Q delays, and other timing constraints [8]. Bitstream generation: Create a bitstream file for programming the FPGA[9]. The bitstream generation process may report errors related to resource over-utilization or unmet constraints [10]. In-system debugging: Use in-system debugging tools such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, or built-in FPGA debugging features to monitor the functionality of your design in the target FPGA device [11]. This can help identify errors related to signal integrity, power supply, or unexpected behavior during actual operation[12].

One common parameter used to measure fuel depletion is the burnup rate, which represents the amount of energy extracted from a unit mass of nuclear fuel and is typically expressed in gigawatt-days per metric ton of uranium (GWd/MTU) [3].

This usually involves the use of Schmitt trigger inputs and pull-up or pull-down resistors to provide a clean and stable digital signal [5]. PIC Microcontroller: A suitable microcontroller, such as the PIC18F family, should be selected for this application[6]. It should have at least two interrupt-on-change (IOC) pins or input capture (IC) channels capable of detecting both rising and falling edges, which are required to determine the rotation direction and speed [7]. Quadrature Decoder Software: The microcontroller should be programmed to implement a quadrature decoder algorithm[8]. This can be done using either a polling method, where the microcontroller continuously checks the state of the input pins, or an interrupt-based method triggered by the changes in the state of the input pins[9]. The algorithm should track the phase relationship between the two channels (A and B) to determine the rotation direction and count the number of pulses to calculate the speed [10]. Output Interface: The microcontroller can then provide the calculated speed and direction information to an external device, such as a display, data logger, or control system, using various communication protocols such as UART, SPI, or I2C [11].

Simulation: Run simulations on your design using a testbench to emulate real-world operating conditions and ensure that the design meets the desired functionality and performance specifications [2]. Logic synthesis: Use synthesis tools to translate the design from a high-level representation (e.g., VHDL or Verilog) to a gate-level netlist[3]. The synthesis tool may report errors or issues if it cannot generate a correct implementation [4]. Place and route: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized logic to the FPGA resources[5].

Static Timing Analysis (STA): Perform STA to ensure that the design meets the timing requirements of the target FPGA[7]. STA can identify timing violations and report errors related to setup and hold times, clock-to-Q delays, and other timing constraints [8]. Bitstream generation: Create a bitstream file for programming the FPGA[9]. The bitstream generation process may report errors related to resource over-utilization or unmet constraints [10]. In-system debugging: Use in-system debugging tools such as logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, or built-in FPGA debugging features to monitor the functionality of your design in the target FPGA device [11]. This can help identify errors related to signal integrity, power supply, or unexpected behavior during actual operation[12].

Some key points to consider are:\n\nOverall, whether cash value life insurance is a good or bad idea depends on your individual financial situation and goals. It's important to evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks carefully and consult with a financial or insurance professional before making a decision.", "references": ["By\n- Whole, universal and guaranteed issues are three types of permanent life insurance that accrue cash value.\n- Term life insurance doesn\u2019t provide an investment opportunity.\n- You might consider investing in cash value life insurance after your 401(k) or IRA contributions are already maxed out.\nLife insurance is a way to provide for your loved ones after you pass. But one type of life insurance can also be used to invest. Cash value life insurance, a form of permanent life insurance , provides a path to accomplish two objectives at once: It accrues cash value that can earn capital gains as an investment, and it pays out to your dependents if you die while the policy is active. You can also tap into your cash value account to invest, pay policy premiums or take out a loan.\nBy contrast, term life insurance \u2014the other main type of life insurance\u2014isn't considered an investment because it only pays out after your death and doesn't include a cash value component.\nLet's take a closer look at using life insurance as an investment, how cash value insurance may factor into your portfolio, and whether there are better ways to invest.\nPermanent life insurance, which includes whole and universal life insurance , accumulates cash value in an account that acts as a savings account. A portion of your premiums goes into your cash value account, and that money grows tax-deferred over time. That means you won't owe taxes on your gains until you withdraw funds. All of your interest stays in the cash account, and it can compound and earn even more interest in the future.\nBecause of its cash value component, permanent life insurance comes with substantially higher premiums than term life. For example, a healthy 35-year-old man might pay around $29.97 in monthly premiums for a 20-year, $500,000 term life policy. However, the premium jumps to $571 per month for a $500,000 permanent life insurance policy.\nYou can choose from three permanent types of life insurance, each of which differs in the way the cash value accumulates:\n- Whole life insurance: With whole life, your monthly premiums are fixed, and the death benefit is guaranteed. Cash value grows at a minimum guaranteed rate, typically ranging from 1% to 2%. While the growth rate is slow compared to other investment types, you can grow a substantial sum over the long term.\n- Universal life insurance: Some universal life insurance policies allow you to adjust your death benefit and lower your premiums if your cash value account has enough funds to cover policy costs. Indexed universal life insurance policies can tie the growth of your cash value to a stock index, such as the S&P 500. For its part, variable universal life can offer investment options from which to choose.\n- Guaranteed issue life insurance: The coverage amounts for guaranteed issue life insurance are lower, typically less than $25,000. Consequently, the potential for cash value growth is also lower.\nOn its face, cash value life insurance is not considered a good investment compared with some traditional investment alternatives, such as the stock market and traditional retirement plans.\nSince cash value accounts grow with guaranteed rates of around 1% to 2%, it can take 10 years or longer to break even with your contributions. On the other hand, you might earn five times that rate by investing in the S&P 500. For nearly a century, stocks of large companies have generated an average annual return of more than 10%.\nOf course, past performance does not predict future results, and the stock market's rate of return isn't guaranteed. Consider your risk tolerance before choosing an investment option.\nRetirement accounts, such as 401(k) plans or IRA accounts, also have higher returns than permanent insurance. According to recent data from Vanguard, the average retirement account that's split evenly between stocks and bonds earns an 8.7% annual rate of return. Again, that's a substantially higher rate than the 1% to 2% range you might average with a cash value life insurance policy.\nSince the IRS limits how much you can contribute to your IRA, 401(k) and other retirement plans, it may make more sense to invest in cash value insurance only when your traditional retirement contributions are maxed out.\nYou can withdraw money or take a loan from your cash value account for almost any purpose, including:\n- Emergency expenses\n- Other investments\n- Supplemental retirement income\n- Premium payments\n- An inheritance for loved ones\nConsidering the low growth rate of cash value life insurance policies, you may consider withdrawing or borrowing from your cash value account and using the money to make other investments. Bear in mind, though, tapping the cash value of a life insurance policy for other investments could reduce your policy's death benefit.\nAnother risk of using your cash value funds for other investments is you may be sacrificing guaranteed gains. If you're using the funds to invest in the stock market, your returns could fluctuate, and your investments could lose value.\nIf you've built up a large cash value, you might consider using it to cover the policy's premiums and invest the money you would have paid toward premiums elsewhere. Keep in mind, though, if you deplete the cash value account, your policy may lapse, and you could lose your coverage altogether.\nYou can also end, or \"surrender,\" your policy if you don't need it any longer and want access to its cash value. In this case, you'll receive the cash balance in your account minus any surrender charges.\nIf you need financial protection for your loved ones but you're unsure about buying life insurance as an investment, consider enrolling in a term life insurance policy. Since term life policies don't offer a cash value component, they're more affordable than permanent life insurance. You can then take the amount you would save and direct it toward more straightforward investment methods, such as:\nInvesting in an employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plan is a smart and easy way to invest in your retirement. Your employer automatically deducts your contributions from your paycheck and deposits the funds into your 401(k) account on a pretax basis. Your funds then grow tax-deferred until you begin making withdrawals. Many employers match contributions up to a specified percentage of an employee's salary. It's generally advised to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to meet your employer's maximum contribution\u2014after all, it's free money. You can fund any amount you like, up to the IRS 401(k) contribution limit .\nIndividual retirement accounts (IRAs) are another excellent alternative to investing in permanent life insurance. Many banks, credit unions, online brokerages and investment companies offer IRA accounts.\nThe two main types of IRAs are traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs :\n- Traditional IRA: You contribute funds with pretax dollars, lowering your taxable income each year you contribute. The fund grows tax-deferred until you begin taking withdrawals in retirement, and taxed as current income after that.\n- Roth IRA: With Roth IRAs, your contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so you won't be able to deduct it on your taxes. Money in the fund grows tax-free, and you can withdraw the money without owing taxes or penalties starting at age 59\u00bd.\nIf you're already contributing to retirement accounts, you might consider investing in stocks and bonds using a brokerage account.\nYou have several ways to invest, depending on your level of market expertise and the level of advice you seek.\n- Online brokerage: Online brokerages, such as TD Ameritrade and Fidelity Investments, are a good option if you don't mind doing your own market research and monitoring your investments yourself.\n- Robo-advisor: Robo-advisors are digital advisors that recommend investments and manage your portfolio using algorithms based on your goals and risk tolerance. Since you aren't meeting in person, fees for robo-advisors are typically lower than financial advisors. You might opt for a robo-advisor if you're not comfortable managing your investments and want to limit fees.\n- Financial advisor: Financial professionals can help you create an overall investment strategy, recommend investments and track portfolio results. Generally, you'll meet in person, and they may recommend investments and track your portfolio's results. This is typically the most costly option, but may be worth it if you are inexperienced, have a significant amount of money to invest or are simply more comfortable working with an experienced professional.\nA cash value life insurance policy may be a good investment if you're already maxing out your 401(k) or IRA account. If you have a sizeable nest egg, a cash value policy can diversify your portfolio while providing you with permanent life insurance. It may also make sense if you're risk-averse and can be satisfied with lower returns than traditional retirement investments.\nAs part of your financial profile, a good credit score can help you save money on life insurance, auto insurance, credit cards, loans and other credit products. Before you apply for life insurance, you can check your credit score and credit report for free with Experian. Doing so will give you a clearer picture of where your credit stands and if you need to take steps to improve your credit ."], "citation_links": ["https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/is-life-insurance-good-investment/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_13f7bd46-c956-429d-8c4e-cafbf89ddf09"}

With matches lasting multiple days and competition being fierce around the world, becoming World Cup Champions is far from easy, but some countries have managed to do so a number of times, etching themselves in the history books. To learn more about these teams and their wins, keep reading below.\n- Australia - 5 Cups\n- India - 2 Cups\n- West Indies - 2 Cups\n- England - 1 Cup\n- Pakistan - 1 Cup\n- Sri Lanka - 1 Cup\nAustralia is by far the most dominant country when it comes to international cricket. Their national team has captured five World Cups in the history of the competition, the most of all time. They lost the first-ever World Cup in 1975 to the West Indies, but they came back with a vengeance. They defeated England in 1987 to earn their first championship, and their most successful stretch was yet to come. From 1999-2007, they won three straight World Cups, a record in the history of the event. The team came back in 2015 to take down New Zealand in a tightly-contested match for their fifth World Cup title.\nWhen many fans think of cricket, they think of India, and the country has certainly produced some of the best talent in the game. Tied for the second-most World Cups all-time with two, India\u2019s national teams have always been in the thick of the competition. Their first win came in 1983, in what was considered a shocking upset over the two-time defending champion West Indies team, but for a while after that, they fell into the background. In 2003, India made it back to the World Cup, only to lose to Australia. However, the team returned in 2011 to win their second title against Sri Lanka.\nWhen the Cricket World Cup was first introduced, the West Indies were the team to beat in international play. Their roster consists of 15 different Caribbean nations, including islands like Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. They won the first-ever World Cup in 1975 and came back in 1979 to repeat as champions. They returned in 1983 looking to become three-time champions, but they suffered what many considered an unforeseeable defeat at the hands of the Indian national team. Since then, the team has not returned to the World Cup.\nOne of three nations with one Cricket World Cup win, England had to be very patient for their first title. They made it to the World Cup in 1979, only to lose to the West Indies, but they didn\u2019t stop there. They made back-to-back appearances in 1987 and 1992, only to lose both times. Finally, in 2019, the team made its fourth World Cup run, and this time they were successful in winning it all, defeating New Zealand after being tied following the conclusion of regulation play.\nOne of the best cricket nations of the 1990s, Pakistan is tied for fourth all-time with one World Cup win. They made it to the finals in 1992 and defeated England, and they also made a run to the championship match in 1999, though they lost to Australia.

This reflects the fact that each college serves one of New Jersey's 21 counties, except for Atlantic Cape Community College , Rowan College of South Jersey , and Raritan Valley Community College , each of which serves two counties. In 1989, the New Jersey Council of County Colleges was created to promote the advancement of the state's county community colleges. In 2003, governor James McGreevey created the New Jersey Community Colleges Compact, through Executive Order No. 81, as a statewide partnership to enable cooperation between the colleges and various state departments. The county colleges of New Jersey represent 56% of all undergraduate students in the state and offer studies in associate degree and certificate programs. Reflecting long-term trends nationwide, the male-to-female ratio of students in the system is 41% male to 59% female, and 48% of students are over the age of 24. Overall, the system enrolls more than 350,000 students each year on campuses that range in size from 1,300 students at Salem Community College to over 15,000 students at Bergen Community College .\nNot all of the county colleges were founded by the State of New Jersey; the oldest county college in New Jersey, Union County College , was founded in 1933 by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration as Union County Junior College; it operated as a private college from 1936 to 1982, and merged with the publicly operated Union County Technical Institute in 1982 to become the current public institution.

Ideal weight range based on height and a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9.\nUnfortunately, BMI does have its limitations. It tends to overestimate or underestimate body fat in certain groups of people. For instance, at the same BMI:\n- men, on average, have less body fat than women\n- Asian people, on average, have more body fat than white people\n- white people, on average, have more body fat than black people\nA high BMI can also result from being lean or muscular, such as in the case of an athlete. This is because muscle is denser and weighs more than fat.\nBMI can also underestimate body fat in older people or those who have lost muscle or bone mass.\nAs mentioned earlier, the average weight for a group of people is not the same as a healthy weight.\nIf the average U.S. man weighs 195.7 pounds and stands 5 feet 9 tall, then his BMI is 28.9. That puts him firmly in the overweight category.\n, 73 percent of men and 66.2 percent of women in the US were estimated to be overweight or obese based on their BMI. These figures were just 60.9 and 51.4 percent for 1988\u20131994. Upward trends in weight have also been observed in other developed nations .\nBeing overweight or obese puts a person at greater risk of developing:\n- type 2 diabetes\n- gallbladder disease\n- osteoarthritis\n- some types of cancer\n- breathing problems, such as sleep apnea\nIt is usually recommended that people with a BMI above 30 should try to lose weight. People with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 should try to prevent further weight gain. However, they should also try to lose weight if they have two or more of the following risk factors:\n- family history of heart disease or diabetes\n- high blood pressure, high LDL or low HDL cholesterol , high triglycerides, diabetes\n- a waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women\nEven losing a small amount of weight can improve overall health, lower blood pressure , and reduce the risk of developing other conditions.\nA doctor can advise on whether a person needs to lose weight or simply stop gaining it. They may also be able to help formulate a weight loss plan or be able to provide access to other professional advice and resources.\nGeneral tips for reaching and maintaining an ideal weight include:\n\u201cExercise more\u201d and \u201ceat less\u201d are too vague, whereas \u201crun 10 miles every day\u201d or \u201close 10 pounds each week\u201d might be unrealistic.\nCommitting to walking for 30 minutes each day or losing 1 to 2 pounds a week, for example, would be far more sensible goals.\nPeople should aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity each week. The exercise should raise the heart rate and cause sweating.\nCycling, swimming, brisk walking, running, dancing, tennis, and soccer are all examples of suitable alternative or additional activities. If possible, an individual should aim for 60\u201390 minutes of exercise a day.\nPeople can try using smaller plates or replacing half of a normal meal with fruit and vegetables. Or aim to reduce consumption by 500 calories per day. Planning meals in advance can help with this.\nThose wanting to lose weight should focus on eating more fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, they should aim to eat leaner meats and get protein from healthier sources, such as poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts.\nReplacing sugary drinks with water or drinking unsweetened tea and coffee is also helpful while also limiting alcohol.\nCalculating BMI can help men determine their ideal weight range. Reaching and maintaining that range can improve health and reduce the risk of developing conditions associated with being overweight or obese.\nLast medically reviewed on February 14, 2018"], "citation_links": ["https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320917"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_907000a5-9b9c-4bde-b90c-6d14de414506"}

While the average weight for men varies depending on height and geographic location, it's important to note that average and healthy weight are not the same.\nMen (and women) who carry excess weight are at a greater risk for health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis . 1 Find out how the average male weight by height compares to other averages over the years and what you can do to maintain a healthy weight.\nThe average man in the U.S. over the age of 20 weighs 199.8 pounds (90.62kg). Note that weight tends to increase with age, with older men weighing about 200 pounds (90.72kg). However, after age 70, weight tends to decrease with age, with the average man weighing about 193.4 pounds (87.72kg). 2\nAlmost three out of every four men in the U.S. is considered to be either overweight or obese. 3 However, the number on the scale can often be misleading. If you suspect you might be overweight, rather than comparing your weight with the average weight of other men your age, calculate your body mass index (BMI) instead.\nBMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a BMI between 25 and 29.9 signifies overweight, and a BMI of 30 or more signifies obesity. 4 This BMI calculator can provide you with an estimate.\nKeep in mind that BMI is only one way to assess weight and doesn\u2019t account for body composition (amount of fat and muscle). Two men could have the same BMI, but for one man, the number may represent an acceptable weight, while for the other, it may represent a risky one.\nLooking at average weights can be deceptive. A man's height, the measurement of his middle, his genetics, and even his ethnicity all play a part in his overall health regardless of what he weighs.\nThe following table compares the average weight and BMI for American men in different age groups based on an average height of about 69 inches, which is 5'9\" (175.3cm). 3 Note that the average BMI scores are above 25, which is considered overweight. In addition, an ideal weight for a man this height is about 152 pounds with a BMI of 22. 5\n|Average Weight for Adult Men in the U.S. (2015\u20132018)|\n|Age group||Average weight|\n|20\u201329||188.6lb (85.54kg)|\n|30\u201339||208.1lb (94.39kg)|\n|40-49||206.9lb (93.85kg)|\n|50-59||202.5lb (91.85kg)|\n|60-69||201.2lb (91.26kg)|\n|70-79||193.4lb (87.72kg)|\n|80 and over||177.5lb (80.51kg)|\nIf you need to lose weight, see your doctor. They can help you come up with a safe, manageable plan for weight loss.\nBMI, weight, height, and head circumference measurements have been collected in the U.S. since the mid-1950s. They've revealed, not surprisingly, that men have been getting taller \u2014and heavier\u2014over the decades.\nA report published in 1959 showed the average weight of male adults (those ages 20 and over) in the U.S. ranged from 151 pounds for a man 5 feet, 4 inches tall to 186 pounds for a 6-foot, 1-inch tall man. At those weights, the BMI of the shorter man would be about 26, and the BMI of the taller man would be 24.5. By today's standards, the shorter man would be considered overweight, and the taller man would be on the higher side of what's regarded as a normal weight. 3\nRegarding height and weight trends, the average height of a man in the U.S. increased by just 1 inch in the 42 years between 1960 and 2002. However, during that same period, the average weight of an American male jumped from around 166 pounds to 191 pounds. 6\nThe biggest increases were found in older men: 6\n- Men between the ages of 40 and 49 saw an average weight increase of 27 pounds.\n- Men between the ages of 50 and 59 logged an increase of 28 pounds.\n- Men 60 and older saw an increase of 33 pounds.\nLooking at the average weights for men can provide some general guidelines for what other people tend to weigh, but these numbers aren't meant to indicate a healthy weight for each individual.\nMaintaining a healthy weight includes a reduced risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other forms of chronic illness. Managing your weight can also help you to live longer. 7 Try these strategies to reach a weight that is healthy for you.\n- Have realistic weight goals : Diets that promise quick weight loss rarely work in the long term. Most experts agree that a healthy and steady rate of weight loss is 1 to 2 pounds per week. Set realistic and sustainable weight loss goals for yourself to promote weight management.\n- Eat a healthy diet : Nutrition that includes a balanced mix of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats from nutrient-dense whole foods is key to managing your weight and maintaining overall health.\n- Stay active : While eating healthy is essential, regular exercise that includes at least 150 minutes of heart-pumping physical activity and two sessions of strength training per week 8 can promote weight loss and weight management. Regular exercise can also reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, cancer, and other chronic health conditions. 9\n- Get enough rest : Research shows that not getting enough sleep can lead to hormonal imbalances , making it more difficult to lose weight and increasing the risk of obesity. 10 Getting enough sleep will also help to ensure you have enough energy to exercise. In addition, you'll be more likely to make healthy food choices when you're well-rested.\nFrom a broad perspective, these types of statistics can offer up an idea of the general health of the male population. They can help you to see where you fall within the statistics, which can be a powerful incentive to lose weight or exercise more if it's clear you're on the higher end of the range for your height and age. Of course, you'll want to get your doctor's perspective as well.\n- What is the average weight for an 18-year-old man?\nAccording to the National Health and Statistics, the average weight for an 18-year-old male is 166.7 pounds. 2 That amount has gradually increased over the years, up from 128 pounds in the 1970s. 6\n- How do you calculate the average body weight for men?\nThe ideal average body weight for men is usually calculated in kilograms: 52 kg + 1.9 kg for each inch over 5 feet. Therefore, the average weight for a man who is 5 feet, 10 inches tall is 71 kilograms or 156.5 pounds. However, the ideal average body weight varies based on body mass index (BMI) and other factors such as age, muscle tone, athleticism, and body frame size.\n- What is the average height of a man in the U.S.?\nThe average height of a man in the United States is 5'9\", which is 69 inches, or 175.3 centimeters.\n- How reliable is BMI as a measurement?\nBMI is not very reliable for individual use. It is meant as a general population statistic. The heavier you are, the more accurate it may be when categorizing overweight and obesity. However, for young people, muscular people, and older individuals, BMI is not accurate.

It can be traced back to the **Book of Common Prayer**, by **Thomas Cranmer**, Archbishop of Canterbury. It is part of the marriage service where the couple swear that they will love each other through thick and thin, forsaking all others, and stay together until death separates them. Is there anything else you would like to know?", "references": ["Updated\nDid you know that weddings are one of the oldest recorded traditions? Ancient documents for marriage agreements have been found in every culture and continent and go back to when contracts were etched into stone! However, it wasn\u2019t until relatively recently that the phrase \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d was used.\nEven today, marriage is generally undertaken as a lifelong commitment to another person. The universal hope when starting out in married life is that the union will end only by death. Read on to learn more about \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d meaning.\nThe phrase \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d means death should be the only thing that will separate the married couple for their whole lives. At times, a euphemism for death might be substituted instead, like \u201cuntil the Lord takes us home.\u201d\nThough this common phrase doesn\u2019t mean that the couple can\u2019t separate if they want to later on, it\u2019s used to emphasize the importance of trying to make a marriage work to the best of your ability.\nThis phrase is also an important part of the ceremony due to the emphasis that parting in marriage should only be for serious matters, not trivial ones.\nThe origin of the phrase \u201cuntil death do us part\u201d is uniquely Christian and dates back to 1549 where it is found in \u201cThe Book of Common Prayer.\u201d The original phrase was slightly different and read \u201ctill death us depart.\u201d\nThe phrase underwent slight variations further down through the years as language evolved and eventually became \u201ctill death we do part\u201d in the 1662 version of \u201cThe Book of Common Prayer.\u201d Later on, the \u201cdo\u201d and \u201cus\u201d were switched and the phrase has remained the same to this day.\nOriginally, the phrase didn\u2019t start as a way to emphasize the importance of making a marriage work out. Instead, it was quite literally a decree that a husband and wife could not be separated for any reason other than death. For Catholics, divorce has historically been unacceptable for any reason except for death.\nEven today, the Catholic Church does not recognize divorce. Societal norms, however, have adjusted and divorce is now a much more acceptable part of life. In light of changing views on marriage, the phrase has now become a customary phrase uttered in Christian and non-Christian weddings, even if religion doesn\u2019t factor into the practice of the couple\u2019s daily lives.\nAs the world has become more modern in social and moral values, the traditional phrase has found its way into pop culture and can be seen everywhere from songs and movies to sitcoms and Broadway plays.\nWhile the majority of movies with wedding scenes use the popular phrase, two movies use the phrase as the title itself \u2014 but it may not be for the reason you expect.\nThis Australian movie used the famous phrase as the title but certainly not in the context you\u2019d imagine.\nThe use of the phrase was rather ironic since the plot of the movie was about an Italian man falling in love with a gangster\u2019s wife who found out and set out to kill his wife\u2019s lover to make them part ways.\nThe phrase was used a second time for the title of a movie in 2017 to address the seriousness of abuse in marriage.\nIn the movie, a happy marriage becomes toxic and the husband becomes completely controlling. The wife is able to escape the marriage only to be found again by the husband.\nThese songs highlight the lifelong commitment of marriage and are appropriately named 'Till Death Do Us Part.'\nWhite Lion was a Danish/American rock band popular in the 1980s and 1990s. The band had a short run but this song was a hit and is used in weddings and romance mixed tapes everywhere.\nLyrics that highlight the forever nature of marriage include, \u201cAll through your life, I\u2019ll be by your side. Till death do us part, I\u2019ll be your friend\u201d and, \u201cMy love will never end, till death do us part. When I wake up every day, with you lying in my arms.\u201d\nAn up-and-coming artist who did well on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d Brian Nhira penned a love song so beautiful that it can be used in weddings everywhere. The song is filled with sentiments about the lifelong nature of marriage as seen in lines such as, \u201cYou\u2019re the one I wanna dance with for the rest of my life. You\u2019re the one I wanna hold and never let go. I need your love till death do us part.\u201d\nMuch of Nhira\u2019s work revolves around love and relationships. In another marriage-focused piece, he asks his wife-to-be if she will still love him when he is old and gray or if their health should fail.\nThrough the message of the song and music video that accompanies it, he shows him and his wife making a lifelong commitment. He makes it clear that because of the \u201ctill death do us part\u201d nature of marriage, leaving is not considered an option. Instead, his song encourages married couples to be there for someone when they go through a difficult time instead of thinking of leaving them to face it alone.\nEven popular household sitcoms have used this phrase, both explicitly and implicitly.\nTill Death Do Us Part aired as a sitcom on British TV that lasted from 1965 to 1975. The sitcom was based on a father and his son-in-law constantly coming to blows as a result of their differing political views.\nSequels of the show were made under slightly different names until the late 1990s. By then, the characters and the title had become a household topic of conversation in Britain from one end of the country to the other.\nThere may be no other show with more recognizable wedding scenes than the show F.R.I.E.N.D.S . Throughout the life of the sitcom, the characters married, divorced, and married again.\nFirst, during Monica and Chandler\u2019s wedding, Chandler tells Monica, \u201cYou are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.\u201d\nThe scene repeats itself during Mike and Phoebe\u2019s wedding. Mike says, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to share my life with you forever.\u201d Though they didn\u2019t use the exact phrase, the implied meaning is the same \u2014 they hope to remain married until death parts them.\nEveryone stands at the altar ready to embark upon what they hope will be a lifelong marriage adventure. However, divorce occurs for a number of reasons, including the stress of deployment, differences in outlook on life, or irreconcilable differences.\nThe good news is that for those who want to make it work, you can find solutions for each of these problems. For some couples, it might be as simple as learning how to stay connected or how to care for someone from far away .\nMany marriages will survive the stress, pressure, and turmoil of life. But even the closest of marriages will eventually experience the death of a partner. As unthinkable as separation from a spouse may seem, one way to stay connected to each other after one passes away is by continuing to wear the symbol of your commitment \u2014 your wedding ring.\nMany people feel unsure of what to do with wedding rings after a death . The simple answer is that there\u2019s no reason why you should stop wearing it if you want to keep it on. Even after death parts you from your spouse, wearing the symbol of your abiding love might help you to keep your spouse near.\nSources\n- The Book of Common Prayer, New York, 1789. justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/1789/Marriage_1789.htm\n- F.R.I.E.N.D.S Vows, Youtube, Uploaded by Lorem Ipsum, 29 Jan.2012. youtube.com/watch?v=M9gWyGoYoAo\n- American Til Death Do Us Part, Youtube, Uploaded by Youtube Movies, 10 Dec. 2018. youtube.com/watch?v=i4-8tJQYbHk\n- Australian Til Death Do Us Part, Internet Movie Database, 1 Sept. 2008. imdb.com/title/tt2326395/\n- Till Death Do Us Part, Youtube, Uploaded by Brian Nihra Music, 16 Sept. 2018. youtube.com/watch?v=rbj72Ld5H-w\n- Till Death Do Us Part, Youtube, Uploaded by White Lion, 22 Jan. 2011. youtube.com/watch?v=NU1zUBDQMz0"], "citation_links": ["https://www.joincake.com/blog/until-death-do-us-part-meaning/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_19d5dd2e-0a57-4ae9-a338-e86272d6f247"}

Cleaning your iPad is very simple, but you need to make sure you're using the proper cleaning products to avoid removing protective coatings. We'll walk you through what to use as an Apple iPad screen cleaner (along with what not to use) and then cover how to clean and disinfect your iPad.\nFun fact: Your iPad has an oleophobic (oil-repellant) coating on the screen. This protects the touch screen on your device from the oils naturally found on your fingertips. While it is normal for this coating to diminish over time with normal usage, using cleaning products with certain ingredients will actually remove this protective coating along with your germs! Because of this, it is important to make sure that your cleaning materials follow the criteria below.\nIf you're a big fan of the iPad and you're ready to actually spring for a new one, but are torn between purchasing the new iPad Air or the iPad Pro, read through our article that hashes out the details to help you better decide.\nDiscover your iPhone\u2019s hidden features\nGet one daily tip each day (with screenshots and clear instructions) so you can master your iPhone in just one minute a day.\nThe following products are recommended by Apple Support to clean and disinfect your iPad:\n- 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe\n- 75% ethyl alcohol wipe\n- Clorox Disinfecting Wipes\n- Lint-free cloth (such as a lens cloth)\n- Products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide\n- Window cleaners, household cleaners, or aerosol sprays\n- Compressed air\n- Abrasive materials (such as paper towels, toilet paper, or other materials with harsh fibers like wood pulp)\nFor more helpful information on how to care for your Apple devices, be sure to sign up for our free Tip of the Day .

Rubbing on it too harshly may damage the oil-repellent finish.\n- If you are using a screen protector, pay special attention to the areas where the protector adheres to your device\u2019s screen, as those little cracks can be great places for germs to hang out.\nNote: Never submerge your iPad in water or any cleaning product (even if you have a water-resistant model).\nOnce you've complete the steps above, you'll have a sparkling tablet sans fingerprints, germs, dirt, and dust. To really get your iPad clean, you should also consider learning how to clean your iPad charging port .\nYou should never use cleaning products on leather or fabric iPad cases, as these will discolor and otherwise damage them.

Ideal weight range based on height and a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9.\nUnfortunately, BMI does have its limitations. It tends to overestimate or underestimate body fat in certain groups of people. For instance, at the same BMI:\n- men, on average, have less body fat than women\n- Asian people, on average, have more body fat than white people\n- white people, on average, have more body fat than black people\nA high BMI can also result from being lean or muscular, such as in the case of an athlete. This is because muscle is denser and weighs more than fat.\nBMI can also underestimate body fat in older people or those who have lost muscle or bone mass.\nAs mentioned earlier, the average weight for a group of people is not the same as a healthy weight.\nIf the average U.S. man weighs 195.7 pounds and stands 5 feet 9 tall, then his BMI is 28.9. That puts him firmly in the overweight category.\n, 73 percent of men and 66.2 percent of women in the US were estimated to be overweight or obese based on their BMI. These figures were just 60.9 and 51.4 percent for 1988\u20131994. Upward trends in weight have also been observed in other developed nations .\nBeing overweight or obese puts a person at greater risk of developing:\n- type 2 diabetes\n- gallbladder disease\n- osteoarthritis\n- some types of cancer\n- breathing problems, such as sleep apnea\nIt is usually recommended that people with a BMI above 30 should try to lose weight. People with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 should try to prevent further weight gain. However, they should also try to lose weight if they have two or more of the following risk factors:\n- family history of heart disease or diabetes\n- high blood pressure, high LDL or low HDL cholesterol , high triglycerides, diabetes\n- a waist circumference greater than 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women\nEven losing a small amount of weight can improve overall health, lower blood pressure , and reduce the risk of developing other conditions.\nA doctor can advise on whether a person needs to lose weight or simply stop gaining it. They may also be able to help formulate a weight loss plan or be able to provide access to other professional advice and resources.\nGeneral tips for reaching and maintaining an ideal weight include:\n\u201cExercise more\u201d and \u201ceat less\u201d are too vague, whereas \u201crun 10 miles every day\u201d or \u201close 10 pounds each week\u201d might be unrealistic.\nCommitting to walking for 30 minutes each day or losing 1 to 2 pounds a week, for example, would be far more sensible goals.\nPeople should aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity each week. The exercise should raise the heart rate and cause sweating.\nCycling, swimming, brisk walking, running, dancing, tennis, and soccer are all examples of suitable alternative or additional activities. If possible, an individual should aim for 60\u201390 minutes of exercise a day.\nPeople can try using smaller plates or replacing half of a normal meal with fruit and vegetables. Or aim to reduce consumption by 500 calories per day. Planning meals in advance can help with this.\nThose wanting to lose weight should focus on eating more fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Also, they should aim to eat leaner meats and get protein from healthier sources, such as poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts.\nReplacing sugary drinks with water or drinking unsweetened tea and coffee is also helpful while also limiting alcohol.\nCalculating BMI can help men determine their ideal weight range. Reaching and maintaining that range can improve health and reduce the risk of developing conditions associated with being overweight or obese.\nLast medically reviewed on February 14, 2018"], "citation_links": ["https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320917"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_7408574c-d32d-438a-ae81-68cbf8cac651"}

Not citing sources properly could imply that the ideas, information, and phrasing you are using are your own, when they actually originated with another author. Plagiarism doesn't just mean copy and pasting another author's words. Review Amber's blog post, \"Avoiding Unintentional Plagiarism,\" for more information! Plagiarism can occur when authors:\n- Do not include enough citations for paraphrased information,\n- Paraphrase a source incorrectly,\n- Do not use quotation marks, or\n- Directly copy and paste phrasing from a source without quotation marks or citations.\nRead more about how to avoid these types of plagiarism on the following subpages and review the Plagiarism Detection & Revision Skills video playlist on this page. For more information on avoiding plagiarism, see our Plagiarism Prevention Resource Kit .\nAlso make sure to consult our resources on citations to learn about the correct formatting for citations.\nCitation issues can appear when writers use too much information from a source, rather than including their own ideas and commentary on sources' information. Here are some factors to consider when citing sources:\n- Did I provide adequate commentary on the cited material?\nRemember that the cited material should illustrate rather than substitute for your point. Make sure your paper is more than a collection of ideas from your sources; it should provide an original interpretation of that material. For help with creating this commentary while also avoiding personal opinion, see our Commentary vs. Opinion resource.\n- Did I begin and end my paragraphs in my own voice?\nThe opening sentence of each paragraph should be your topic sentence , and the final sentence in the paragraph should conclude your point and lead into the next. Without these aspects, you leave your reader without a sense of the paragraph's main purpose. Additionally, the reader may not understand your reasons for including that material.\n- Have I used the cited material to support my specific thesis?\nAll material that you cite should contribute to your main argument (also called a thesis or purpose statement). When reading the literature, keep that argument in mind, noting ideas or research that speaks specifically to the issues in your particular study. See our synthesis demonstration for help learning how to use the literature in this way.\n- Have I relied too heavily on one source?\nMost research papers should include a variety of sources from the last 3-5 years. You may find one particularly useful study, but try to balance your references to that study with research from other authors. Otherwise, your paper becomes a book report on that one source and lacks richness of theoretical perspective.\n- Have I included too many direct quotations?\nDirect quotations are best avoided whenever possible. While direct quotations can be useful for illustrating a rhetorical choice of your author, in most other cases paraphrasing the material is more appropriate. Using your own words by paraphrasing will better demonstrate your understanding and will allow you to emphasize the ways in which the ideas contribute to your paper's main argument.\nPlagiarism Detection and Revision Skills Video Playlist (8 videos)"], "citation_links": ["https://academicguides.waldenu.edu/writingcenter/evidence/citations"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_338480aa-2c6e-4e35-aecd-1ac3d871eda1"}

In these cases, the debate continues as to whether freedom of speech should be protected or not.", "references": ["Freedom of speech\u2014the right to express opinions without government restraint\u2014is a democratic ideal that dates back to ancient Greece. In the United States, the First Amendment guarantees free speech, though the United States, like all modern democracies, places limits on this freedom. In a series of landmark cases, the U.S. Supreme Court over the years has helped to define what types of speech are\u2014and aren\u2019t\u2014protected under U.S. law.\nThe ancient Greeks pioneered free speech as a democratic principle. The ancient Greek word \u201cparrhesia\u201d means \u201cfree speech,\u201d or \u201cto speak candidly.\u201d The term first appeared in Greek literature around the end of the fifth century B.C.\nDuring the classical period, parrhesia became a fundamental part of the democracy of Athens. Leaders, philosophers, playwrights and everyday Athenians were free to openly discuss politics and religion and to criticize the government in some settings.\nIn the United States, the First Amendment protects freedom of speech.\nThe First Amendment was adopted on December 15, 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights\u2014the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution . The Bill of Rights provides constitutional protection for certain individual liberties, including freedoms of speech, assembly and worship.\nThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t specify what exactly is meant by freedom of speech. Defining what types of speech should and shouldn\u2019t be protected by law has fallen largely to the courts.\nIn general, the First Amendment guarantees the right to express ideas and information. On a basic level, it means that people can express an opinion (even an unpopular or unsavory one) without fear of government censorship.\nIt protects all forms of communication, from speeches to art and other media.\nWhile freedom of speech pertains mostly to the spoken or written word, it also protects some forms of symbolic speech. Symbolic speech is an action that expresses an idea.\nFlag burning is an example of symbolic speech that is protected under the First Amendment. Gregory Lee Johnson, a youth communist, burned a flag during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas to protest the Reagan administration.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court , in 1990, reversed a Texas court\u2019s conviction that Johnson broke the law by desecrating the flag. Texas v. Johnson invalidated statutes in Texas and 47 other states prohibiting flag burning.\nNot all speech is protected under the First Amendment.\nForms of speech that aren\u2019t protected include:\n- Obscene material such as child pornography\n- Plagiarism of copyrighted material\n- Defamation (libel and slander)\n- True threats\nSpeech inciting illegal actions or soliciting others to commit crimes aren\u2019t protected under the First Amendment, either.\nThe Supreme Court decided a series of cases in 1919 that helped to define the limitations of free speech. Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917, shortly after the United States entered into World War I . The law prohibited interference in military operations or recruitment.\nSocialist Party activist Charles Schenck was arrested under the Espionage Act after he distributed fliers urging young men to dodge the draft. The Supreme Court upheld his conviction by creating the \u201cclear and present danger\u201d standard, explaining when the government is allowed to limit free speech. In this case, they viewed draft resistant as dangerous to national security.\nAmerican labor leader and Socialist Party activist Eugene Debs also was arrested under the Espionage Act after giving a speech in 1918 encouraging others not to join the military. Debs argued that he was exercising his right to free speech and that the Espionage Act of 1917 was unconstitutional. In Debs v. United States the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Espionage Act.\nThe Supreme Court has interpreted artistic freedom broadly as a form of free speech.\nIn most cases, freedom of expression may be restricted only if it will cause direct and imminent harm. Shouting \u201cfire!\u201d in a crowded theater and causing a stampede would be an example of direct and imminent harm.\nIn deciding cases involving artistic freedom of expression the Supreme Court leans on a principle called \u201ccontent neutrality.\u201d Content neutrality means the government can\u2019t censor or restrict expression just because some segment of the population finds the content offensive.\nIn 1965, students at a public high school in Des Moines, Iowa , organized a silent protest against the Vietnam War by wearing black armbands to protest the fighting. The students were suspended from school. The principal argued that the armbands were a distraction and could possibly lead to danger for the students.\nThe Supreme Court didn\u2019t bite\u2014they ruled in favor of the students\u2019 right to wear the armbands as a form of free speech in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District . The case set the standard for free speech in schools. However, First Amendment rights typically don\u2019t apply in private schools.\nWhat does free speech mean?; United States Courts .\nTinker v.

Can plastic still be a green option?\nI\nIn many countries, plastic straws are increasingly hard to come by. In the UK, where I live, they were banned completely at the end of 2020 along with plastic coffee stirrers . So when I am offered a straw in a restaurant or caf\u00e9 now, it's usually made of paper.\nBut these paper straws bend and go limp after a few minutes in my drink, and in the end they all go in the general waste, either to an incinerator to be burned to produce energy, or to landfill.\nDo I really want a paper straw? I am lucky enough to be able to lift that glass to my lips, so I might as well do so. And just like that, a step towards zero waste is taken, and it feels good.\nSingle-use plastics seem to be disappearing. Australia has had a plastic bag ban since 2018. India followed the UK with a ban on straws, cutlery and food packaging in July 2022. In my home country of France, plastics are now banned on fresh fruit and vegetables.\nWhile plastic waste is a problem, plastic is also a useful material in which to package food. So why is it the subject of so much attention? And does plastic still have a place on our supermarket shelves?\nIn 2018, we produced two billion tonnes of solid waste globally , of which 275 million tonnes was plastic. With the world population predicted to double by 2050, waste will increase by 70%.\nGlobally, packaging is the largest source of plastic waste \u2013 and by some margin. In 2015, 141 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste was generated , compared to 42 million tonnes of plastic textile waste \u2013 which was the next largest sector.\nSome countries are able to recycle most of their plastic waste. Up to 56% is recycled in Germany, closely followed by Austria, South Korea and Wales . But the global picture is quite different \u2013 15% of plastics go to recycling, but 40% of this waste is rejected for contamination or other issues, meaning only 9% of plastic waste is actually recycled . By contrast, metals can have an up to 100% recycle rate.\nEnvironmental plastic pollution is linked to cancers, hormone disruption and loss of fertility (Credit: Getty Images)\nBut while unsightly, plastic straws and cling wraps are only a small contributor to plastic packaging pollution. This got me thinking; how much of a difference will plastic packaging bans make? And is plastic always the villain it is made out to be?\nIs plastic the public enemy it is made out to be?\nIt is very complex to evaluate life cycles of materials, and in certain cases there is obvious plastic bashing, says Romane Osadnick, an account manager at Adelphe, a French non-profit company founded to reduce the impact of household packaging materials. Osadnick helps companies identify and calculate the emissions from their packaging to help to reduce them.\n\"Plastic can sometimes be the best option,\" Osadnick says, \"especially in the food industry. Film wraps and plastic bags that seal food [like cucumber wraps] preserve the quality of the food and are lightweight options.\"\nFrance recently banned the use of plastic wrapping in the food industry . When walking down the fruit and vegetable aisles of a French supermarket, you are now likely to see only loose items, with occasional styrofoam nets wrapping exotic fruit (or plastic bags for larger quantities like bags of apples).\nWill other countries follow suit? Personally, I have seen the amount of plastic wrapping in British supermarket decrease rapidly since arriving in London a year and a half ago, but smaller chain supermarkets still tend to offer little to no loose vegetable options.\nIn the end it often turns out to be more polluting to use cardboard wrapping than plastic, when the entire food production chain is taken into account \u2013 Romane Osadnick\nThe journey from the field to the supermarket or market stall requires packaging to protect the produce. So in France, cucumbers, which might once have been wrapped in clear plastic film, are now delivered to supermarkets in containers made of alternative materials. \"Plastic is most commonly replaced with cardboard,\" Osadnick says, \"but food can be damaged more easily in cardboard causing more food waste in transport, and it weighs much heavier [which] means in turn that more lorries are needed to carry the same quantity of product. Transport weighs heavily in the life cycle of food. In the end it often turns out to be more polluting to use cardboard wrapping than plastic, when the entire food production chain is taken into account.\" Though, to be able to prove in any one particular case that carboard is more costly, a life cycle assessment would be required.\nAn Indian company designed this cutlery made from dried and pressed palm leaves (Credit: Getty Images)\nLikewise, a life cycle assessment of single-use plastic, plastic \"bags for life\", cotton and paper shopping bags found that cotton and paper had the highest negative impacts for measures like fossil fuel use.\nThere may be an appropriate time, then, to use plastic. Perhaps the problem is that we are accustomed to using plastic only once and discarding it. The prevalence of plastic waste has led to serious concerns about the effect it has on human health. Plastics leach a class of chemical called endocrine disruptors , which can block or change how hormones are used in our bodies. Plastics are sometimes coated with polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) \u2013 often referred to as \"forever chemicals\" \u2013 which have been linked to several diseases.\nAre there better examples elsewhere that could inspire alternatives? India, like much of the world, has an expanding plastic problem. Plastic waste per person doubled between 2016 and 2020 .\n\"In Delhi, street food used to be served in a banana leaf container and the cutlery was also made of natural material,\" says Harsh Malhotra, an Indian urban designer. Malhotra grew up in Delhi, then lived in the Netherlands and UK before moving back to his home country.\nIn Coming Clean , BBC Future uncovers the tricks and misdirections that we should all look out for when we see claims about sustainability.\nOur mission is to give you the tools to spot verifiable facts from meaningless buzzwords, and to provide a rational explanation of greenwashing tactics.\n\"I remember walking to the farmer's market with my grandfather as a very young child, he would always carry a cloth carrier bag on the shoulder,\" says Malhotra. \"Somehow, my parents lost the habit, and\u2026 the greengrocer now wraps greens individually before storing them in my carrier bag. I can't help but wonder where it went wrong.\"\nThose banana leaf containers might be making a comeback. One Indian 20-year-old used this centuries-old tradition as inspiration to develop a technique to prevent leaves from degrading for up to three years . After treating the leaves with UV and shaping them into plates and cups, they can be used and reused as plastic replacements. This take on a traditional practice promotes a local sustainable solution and cultural heritage.\nAssessing the life cycle of a material is complex. For instance, producing glass is very energy intensive, but if it is well kept it can be cleaned and reused perhaps indefinitely.\nLinda Gaines, an environmental scientist at Argonne National Laboratory in the US, and her late colleague Max Mintz found that although you can recycle glass indefinitely through melting, this process does not save a significant amount of energy compared with primary glass production \u2013 at best it saves 13% of the energy . Glass is more eco-friendly than plastic only if it is reused and in many cases (due to the lack of glass collecting networks), plastic might be more sustainable.\n\"In emerging economies the cost of [producing] beverages is cheaper than in the industrialised world,\" Nathan Dufour from Zero Waste Europe, an NGO that is trying to find alternatives to incinerators, explains. \"As a result, the cost of packaging represents a higher proportion of the total price. This explains why it makes more economic sense to keep refillable packaging, be it in glass or plastic, in countries in the global South,\" he says.\n\"So, big consumer brands have transitioned away from refillables to single-use packaging faster in the global North than in the South; it simply made more economic sense,\" he says.\nDufour suggests that if companies are shown economically interesting ways of being sustainable they will go for the more sustainable option without a second thought. Consumers can contribute to tipping the balance to the more sustainable side.\nPlastic is a victim of its own success: cheap, light and flexible. It's so cheap that many of use don't question using it once and throwing it away. It's so useful that we find it everywhere. While plastic waste is a pressing problem, its properties mean that it still has an important part to play, particularly in transporting food.\nSo before we give up on plastic, perhaps we should think about how to use, and reuse, it better.\n--\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook , or follow us on Twitter or Instagram .\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter , called \"The Essential List\" \u2013 a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future , Culture , Worklife , Travel and Reel delivered to your inbox every Friday."], "citation_links": ["https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220711-do-single-use-plastic-bans-work"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_b11a5339-92a3-4c44-a8f5-01735c92b523"}

Read on and I'll explain the details, and there's a number of them.\n\"You can't eat any wild mushrooms raw\" is the mantra of plenty of mushroom clubs and mushroom hunters around the United States, and although I don't like engaging in online debates too much, ( I know I'll get a few emails after I post this ) the \"can you eat mushrooms raw\" question is one that I will debate on all day.\nIt's an issue that a number of wild mushroom hunters I know have a particular zeal for, and, like all good debatable things, is not a simple yes or no question. I'm going to do my best to explain why you can eat some wild mushrooms raw and how to go about it safely, if it interests you.\nI'd say 99% of edible wild mushrooms shouldn't be eaten raw, but the one percent left over are exciting, delicious, and are worth seeking out.\nThere's a catch though, and it's a big one. The catch, is that the vast majority of edible wild mushrooms should not be eaten raw. Period.\nHeck, I'd say 99.% of wild mushrooms shouldn't be eaten raw. First, I think it's useful to address and consider the obvious, that most people in America will have, at least at one point in time, have gone to a salad bar and seen the ubiquitous, sliced, raw button mushrooms sitting next to the black olives and yellow banana peppers.\nBut, there's a big difference between those raw, sad white mushrooms from the salad bar, and wild mushrooms. Edible wild mushrooms can be any number of different species, all with different shapes, sizes, aromas, and, even toxic properties.\nThere's numerous wild mushrooms commonly eaten by hunters like my self that are both edible, and toxic, including, but not limited to: morels and their cousins, Leccinum / scaber stalks, blewits, honey mushrooms, edible amanitas, and I could go on.\nEat those raw, and you can get very sick, some of them could even put you in the hospital. But, if you cook them, the mushrooms are edible, and safe since exposure to high, prolonged heat (or par-blanching in the instance of Amanita muscaria and some Gyromitra ), denatures the problematic compounds, although an unlucky few people have or can develop allergies to them, even after cooking.\nI have one friend, who can't eat morel mushrooms, any morels, if he has alcohol with his meal. I know another friend who only gets sick when he eats a specific type of black morel when consumed with alcohol.\nAnother person I know can't have hedgehog mushrooms, at all, and gets horribly sick from eating them even well cooked. Some people can't have lobster mushrooms, others have their lips tingle and get slightly numb from eating chicken of the woods.\nTo be clear, those sort of individual sensitivities are outliers here, and discussing them is outside the scope of this post.\nSo, the question is, why would, or should you, ever eat a raw mushroom, if you can cook them?\nIn short, because some mushrooms are edible raw, safe to eat, and certain ones are absolutely delicious. There's even some wild mushrooms I prefer not to cook, for the most part (for the record that's beefsteaks and truffles).\nOh, and I would be remiss if I didn't address the chitin digestibility argument here. People love to say \"you cant eat mushrooms raw! Don't you know mushroom tissue is made of chitin--that's like eating crab shells--humans can't digest crabshells!\"\nThe crab argument is partially right, but the small truth that humans can't digest chitin is a moot point, and is really just a phrase that gets parroted from person to person often to bolster their cause, without people thinking critically about it.\nSure, we can't digest crab shells, I get that. Tell me though, when's the last time you saw someone eat a crabshell? Crab shells are spikey, and, not inviting, although they do make delicious stock and compound butter.\nShrimp shells, on the other hand, are also made of chitin, and people do eat those, some with relish, especially when the shrimp have just molted and the shells are very thin.\nI don't eat shrimp shells myself, both since I don't live near the cost and since I usually save them to make stock, but it's a thing.\nSo, why would someone eat a shrimp shell if they can't digest it? Well, big surprise here: people eat shrimp shells because they like the taste, err texture, or maybe both in this case.\nWhat I'm getting at is that humans and other animals commonly eat things that they can't digest for some reason or another. Dogs eat grass for digestive issues, so do cats. People eat all manner of weird shit, in fact, I'd wager humans eat the largest amount of things as a species that we can't digest \"properly\" compared to any other species in the world.\nI mean c'mon, most of us can remember the first time we noticed what happens after we eat an ear of sweet corn! In fact, corn is a great example here.\nHumans don't get much from eating corn, nutritionally speaking. Sweet corn, or corn kernals, have a little (or a lot) of sugar, some fiber, starch, but, not too much else in them.\nCorn is actually deficient of a number of vitamins and minerals, and if we humans eat too much corn, it is a well known fact that we can get something called pellagra, a nutrient deficiency that spread after Europeans brought corn from the New World, around the world.\nGuess what? (Quick aside here) Native Americans didn't got pellagra, they learned eons before that they could derive more nourishment from corn if it underwent a chemical process called nixtamalization, which is how we got tortillas and masa.\nThe point is, millions of people will butter up an ear of corn this summer and not give a thought to if they can \"digest it properly\". The sweet corn-eaters, myself included, eat that buttery steaming ear of indigestible kernals because it tastes good to them.\nAnd that, is about as good of an analogy as I can find for the argument that you can eat some wild mushrooms raw, not care if you digest them \"properly\" and even (gasp!) enjoy them.\nBut, before I tell you about why you might enjoy some select raw favorites, we should mention dosage. The amount of wild mushrooms I'll eat raw is very different from the amounts I'll eat cooked.\nTo put it in perspective, when I do eat wild mushrooms raw, it's generally in small amounts in a salad, or an appetizer, maybe an ounce at the most, typically much less, roughly half and ounce, or even less.\nA little raw shroom can go along way, especially with something as aromatic as matsutake or truffles. By contrast, when I eat cooked mushrooms, I usually consider 2 oz of fresh mushrooms a decent serving.\nNot sold on raw shrooms yet? Don't worry I have more. The next thing that's good to look at, are a few particular mushrooms, and from there, a couple culinary traditions, specifically Italian, French, and Japanese. Here's the big ones that are the best examples I know of (if you know of more, chime in!).\nThese are the mushrooms that come to mind when I think of wild mushrooms I enjoy eating raw, in small amounts, on occasion.\nThis is not a complete list, and even some raw mushroom eaters might disagree with me on black trumpets, but I've been served them multiple times in France, along with golden chanterelles. This list is all mushrooms I have consumed personally, and in more than one case served to others either in restaurants or small gatherings. There's a few notes on each type.\nDating at least back to the Romans, porcini could arguably be the poster child for raw mushroom consumption. Porcini have been eaten for a long time in Italy in their beloved insalata di porcini made of sliced raw mushrooms with parmigiano cheese, olive oil, and hopefully arugula and a good squeeze of lemon, maybe even a few slices of proscuitto.\nIt's a delicious salad\u2014the mushrooms stay crisp and fresh, but have a rich, earthy taste. Every mushroom hunter should try a salad of raw porcini at least once. That being said, you need to know your boletes here , and if you're going to serve someone a raw porcini salad who hasn't had it before, you should be very comfortable with your local species and serve to others only in small amounts.\nMatsutake are loved in Asia, specifically Japan and Korea. Matsutake are most well-known for famous dishes they grace like matsutake gohan, but a little known snack served at some sushi restaurants is, you guessed it: raw matsutake.\nRaw matsutake have a powerful fragrance, so powerful some people won't like it. Powerful aromas and tastes are one of the hallmarks of a good delicacy though.\nAnother breadcrumb the Romans left behind is the second one in this list they named. Amanita caesarea literally means caesars mushroom, and it was reputedly served to them.\nIf the mushrooms were specifically served raw I don't know, since the only references I have of them in old Roman books are cooked, but it wouldn't be an outlandish thing to consider.\nThe Romans certainly ate stranger things. What I do know is that Caesar's mushroom are being eaten, possibly as I type this in France and Italy, and, I've eaten them myself.\nIn the open-air market of Aix-en-Provence, I got to try my first Amanita caesarea dipped in Provencal olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt. It was excellent, and the mushrooms are served in salads like you might porcini.\nBeefsteak mushrooms are special in that they're the only polypore-type mushroom I know of that I enjoy raw. They're also one of the only mushrooms that I prefer to eat raw whenever I have them. Other polypores like hen of the woods and chicken of the woods mushrooms can have a bitter taste fresh, and chickens, depending on the type, could cause stomach problems with a few people.\nBeefsteak polypores though were born to eat raw. Beefsteaks have a gentle tart flavor to them that reminds me of weak sorrel, with the mushrooms I've had tasting cleaner and more pleasant young.\nBeefsteaks can be eaten just like you would porcini, and are likewise delicious eaten with olive oil, crunchy salt and fresh pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon. The only downside to beefsteaks, if it can even be said, is that they're rare, at least for me.\nWe can't forget about truffles. Just the thought of a waiter bringing over a truffle slicer and making it rain mushroom slices of the richest mushroom perfume is enough for most people to blow their, er, wine cork. I know here, some people will be quick to point out that truffles are small balls of mycelial tissue, and not technically mushrooms, but, for all intents and purposes, truffles are mushrooms.\nTruffles are a world unto themselves, with new ones seeming to enter our culinary lexicon regularly--each one having subtle preferences and preparations they lend themselves to better than others.\nFor example: black truffles are great raw and good cooked, slowly-simmered black truffle risotto being one of the most famous dishes I know to use them. Other truffles don't like to be cooked at all, and could have their flavor ruined by too much heat, specifically white truffles, including the famous Alba white, bainchetto, and the Hungarian honey truffle, all of which I've enjoyed.\nThese are probably the least known wild mushroom I've seen people eat raw, and, with the amount of raw black trumpets I eat when I incorporate them raw into a dish, it's almost not even worth mentioning, almost.\nWhen I eat black trumpets raw they're a novelty-a garnish strewn on something or a final touch as a way to add some volume or an interesting garnish (the same way I was served them at Jacques Chibois, in Provence.\nI've heard of black trumpets being called poor mans truffles, and that's how I use them raw: in tiny amounts, sprinkled on top as a garnish, a few slivers--nothing more.

Others suggest that memorials should not be erected until at least 10 years after the war has ended. The evolution and continued resonance of remembrance rituals in post-World War I Britain has also been explored.", "references": ["On my first deployment to Iraq, in 2004, our infantry battalion of several hundred Marines lost 21 killed in action. Immediately, we erected our own modest memorials: An ever-expanding roster of the photographs of the fallen hung outside our battalion headquarters in Fallujah; many of us wrote the names of lost friends in black marker on the inside of our body armor, to keep them close; eventually, firebases were dedicated in their honor. The impulse to memorialize was powerful. We did it for them, but also for ourselves. A promise to remember was also a promise that if we, too, were killed, we would not be forgotten.\nIt has been 17 years since the attacks of September 11, and the wars we\u2019ve been fighting since then haven\u2019t yet ended. Already, though, in 2017, Congress passed the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act, which authorized the construction of a monument on the National Mall. In order to pass it, Congress had to exempt the memorial from a requirement that prohibits erecting such monuments until ten years after a war\u2019s conclusion. Supporters argued that waiting wasn\u2019t a reasonable option: Before too long, the war\u2019s earliest combatants might not be around to witness the dedication, and besides, there\u2019s no telling if and when these wars will finally conclude. Which, of course, only highlights the challenges\u2014even the paradox\u2014of memorializing an ongoing war that is now our nation\u2019s longest overseas conflict.\nCommunities around the country have already erected their own memorials, approximately 130 across the 50 states as of this writing. Both privately and publicly funded, they are varied in size and design, placed in front of high schools, in public parks, at colleges and universities. With the future national monument in mind, this past Memorial Day weekend I set out to visit a few of them, to see whether they might shed some light on how to memorialize wars that haven\u2019t ended, and might never.\n* * *\nI arrive on a muggy Friday afternoon at the Old North Church in Boston\u2019s North End, made famous by Paul Revere, whose men hung lanterns\u2014\u201cOne if by land, and two if by sea\u201d\u2014from its steepled bell tower. With a guide, I ascend into that same bell tower, which creaks in the wind and boasts commanding views of Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill, as well as dozens of Bostonians sunbathing on their rooftops. As it happens my military career began in Boston, as a naval ROTC midshipman at Tufts University. This was right before the 9/11 attacks, and I had fully expected that I would serve in peacetime.\nThe outbreak of war is often unexpected. As if to reinforce this fact, my guide ushers me from the church\u2019s highest point to its lowest: the crypt, where 1,100 sets of remains are walled into the church\u2019s foundations. Many are British soldiers: The beginning of the Revolution took loyalists by surprise, and the basement of the Old North Church, where the congregation was largely loyal to the British crown, became one of the few places their British protectors could be peacefully interred. As the war dragged on, however, prominent revolutionaries would soon be mixed in among them, including Capt. Samuel Nicholson, the first commander of the USS Constitution , the oldest U.S. naval vessel still afloat, on whose decks I was commissioned a second lieutenant before heading to Iraq.\nWe exit the crypt and come into the light of the back garden, where since 2006 the church has housed a memorial to the fallen of the Iraq and Afghan wars, making it the oldest such memorial in the country. At first, the memorial was humble, a cross or Star of David made from popsicle sticks for each service member killed.\nThese markers proved less than durable, and the congregation soon changed the design to something more lasting. Now six tall posts are planted into the soil, in the shape of a horseshoe. Strung between each pair are wires, and hanging from them are dog tags, giving the effect of a shimmering, semicircular wall. On Saturday mornings, Bruce Brooksbank, a congregant and the memorial\u2019s volunteer coordinator, visits for about two hours. He tends the garden, which is planted with red and white forget-me-nots. In his pocket he carries a few blank dog tags and, after checking iCasualties.org, he adds however many are required. At the time of writing, there are 6,978. When the dog tags catch the light, reflections dance on the ground. Bruce says that the light reminds him of angels, and the chime from the wind passing through them their voices.\nA little girl steps into the garden and reaches for the dog tags. Her mother moves to stop her, but Bruce encourages her to touch them. \u201cHow do you like my garden?\u201d he asks. Children are his favorite visitors, he explains. They arrive without political or historical preconceptions; they aren\u2019t pro-war or antiwar; they didn\u2019t vote for Bush or for Kerry. Their reaction is pure. Though they may not understand something as abstract as a pair of never-ending wars, they respond to the experience of seeing what\u2019s been built here at the Old North Church.\nThe memorial is on a slight rise beside a brick pathway, and most of its visitors seem to happen upon it. When they learn what it is, they appear almost startled. In the hour that I sit with Bruce, nearly everyone who comes along slows to consider it. One young man, maybe a college student, strolls past wearing a tank top, khaki shorts, flip-flops and electric green plastic sunglasses. He stops and stares up at the memorial as though it\u2019s a mountain he has yet to summit. Then he breaks down crying. He looks up at the monument a second time, and then breaks down again. The outburst is quick, less than a minute. Then he leaves.\nWhen I ask Bruce if he has thoughts about a design for the national monument, he says, \u201cThrough simplicity you have power.\u201d\n* * *\nBattleship Memorial Park sits on 175 acres at the northern tip of Mobile Bay, where the World War II-era USS Alabama rests at anchor. Scattered across the park\u2019s acreage, as though staged for an invasion, is an impressive array of vintage military hardware. Calamity Jane , a retired B-52 Stratofortress, is installed next to where I\u2019ve parked my rental car; it\u2019s one of many long-range bombers that dropped its tonnage of explosives on North Vietnam. Its night camouflage is tattooed with red bomblets near the cockpit, each one designating a successful combat mission.\nI\u2019ve flown down to Mobile to see the Fallen Hero 9/11 Memorial, honoring Alabamians killed in service since 9/11, in whose shadow I\u2019m now standing with Nathan Cox. Before joining the Marines, Nathan played fullback for the University of Alabama, where he also graduated summa cum laude. He\u2019s got a bad knee from the football; sometimes it locks up on him. \u201cWhile I was in the Corps, it got a lot worse,\u201d he says, stretching out the leg.\nNathan, who like me was an infantry officer\u2014in fact, we served in the same division within a year of each other in Iraq\u2014led the initiative to erect this memorial, which was dedicated on September 11, 2015. \u201cThis memorial,\u201d he says, \u201cis just us trying to say something good.\u201d\nThe centerpiece of the monument, designed by a local artist named Casey Downing Jr., also a veteran, is a stout, flat-topped black granite hexagonal base on top of which is a bronze replica of combat boots, a helmet and dog tags arrayed around a rifle bayoneted into the granite. Historically, to mark the location of fallen soldiers on the battlefield, their comrades would bayonet a rifle into the dirt. This has evolved into a traditional symbol honoring fallen soldiers. I remember the horseshoe of 21 boots, helmets, dog tags and rifles at our infantry battalion\u2019s final memorial service.\nEngraved on one side of the monument are the names of the Alabamians killed in these wars, with space, of course, for future additions. On each of the other five sides hangs a bronze bas-relief honoring a service member in his or her dress uniform from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard. Twin brick pathways, a shade darker than the brickwork surrounding the monument, lead from the back of the monument like shadows to a pair of rectangular black granite towers, representing the World Trade Center\u2019s twin towers, standing side by side at about eight feet tall, and etched with a narrative describing the events of September 11 and the subsequent \u201cGlobal War on Terror.\u201d The text concludes with a quote attributed to George Orwell:\nPeople sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because\nrough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\nNathan, who joined the Corps in response to the 9/11 attacks, and is now a successful real estate developer, spent eight years raising the half-million dollars needed to build the memorial from private donations. \u201cAlabama\u2019s such a patriotic place,\u201d he says, holding his restless son, Luke, who squirms in his arms. \u201cEverywhere you asked,\u201d he adds, \u201cpeople wanted to help.\u201d\nWe stand together considering his memorial. \u201cYou know, when it was time for our generation\u2019s war, I just wanted to be there,\u201d he says. It is late in the afternoon, time for him to take his son home, and when he walks back to his truck, I notice that he limps a bit.\n* * *\nThe next morning, a Sunday, I head north. The highway runs over the water and then across the marshlands that feed into Mobile Bay. I take on elevation, eventually entering Tennessee, where a half-hour outside of Nashville, in Murfreesboro, I stop to have dinner at a Cracker Barrel before settling into a motel room nearby.\nThroughout the drive, I\u2019ve been swapping text messages with Colby Reed, a former Marine corporal and Afghan war veteran who\u2019s from the area. Colby has volunteered to take me to the local war memorial in Murfreesboro. We make plans to have breakfast the following morning. I ask him to recommend a place, and he suggests the Cracker Barrel, so I\u2019m back there the next morning. It\u2019s Monday\u2014Memorial Day.\nThe place is packed, but Colby stands out as he makes his way through the crowd toward my table. He\u2019s still in good shape, with broad shoulders, and he wears an olive drab T-shirt from his old unit, Third Battalion, Eighth Marine Regiment. He\u2019s brought his wife with him. She\u2019s in law school. He was a cop until recently and is now teaching criminal justice in high school while enrolled in college himself.\nColby enlisted in the Marines at 17, in 2009. When I ask him why, he says, \u201c9/11.\u201d When I point out to Colby that this seems like a rather dramatic reaction for a 9-year-old to have had, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma around millennials, but people forget that millennials fought America\u2019s longest wars as volunteers.\u201d\nI was born in 1980, which is supposed to make me a millennial, but I\u2019ve never felt like one. I mentioned this once to a friend of mine about my age, a former bomb technician who also fought in Iraq. He said he\u2019d never felt like a millennial either, so he\u2019d come up with a different generational criterion: If you were old enough to have an adult reaction to the September 11 attacks, you\u2019re not a millennial.\nSo maybe I\u2019m not a millennial after all, and maybe Colby isn\u2019t one either. At 9 years old he decided to enlist, and eight years later he went through with it, convincing his parents to sign an age waiver. Wars, which were once shared as generational touchstones, are no longer experienced the same way in this country because of our all-volunteer military. I\u2019ve often wondered: In the past, did this make the return home less jarring? Maybe so. I\u2019d rather be part of a lost generation, I think, than be the lost part of a generation.\nAfter breakfast, we go to the Rutherford County Courthouse, in the Murfreesboro square, quintessential small-town America. Colby jokes how much the courthouse and the square resemble the set of Back to the Future . On the southeast corner of the courthouse green is the memorial, dedicated in 1948 by the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Admittedly, it isn\u2019t much: five conjoined granite slabs of varying heights with names and places chiseled into the stone. Because it\u2019s Memorial Day, a few roses have been left at the base. Across the slabs is engraved: THESE OUR WAR DEAD IN HONORED GLORY REST.\nWhat we see is plain and unadorned. Unlike the dog tags refashioned as wind chimes in the Memorial Garden in Boston, nothing about this memorial is conceptual. Unlike the Fallen Hero 9/11 Memorial in Mobile, it isn\u2019t grand or triumphant. This memorial is quiet, straightforward, conveying only the essentials. What else is there to say?\nColby stares at the names of five Murfreesboro native sons killed in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014his wife went to high school with one of the guys\u2014along with dozens of names from the First World War, Second World War, Korea and Vietnam. Colby is aware of the story that I\u2019m writing, and that nobody knows what the memorial on the National Mall will be like, which is why without prompting he says, \u201cIf they just gave us a little piece of land. A wall with our names. That\u2019d be enough.\u201d\n* * *\nOften, since coming home, I\u2019ve had strangers tell me they can\u2019t imagine what I went through. These comments are always made with kindness, with deference and sympathy; but I have always found them disempowering. If somebody can\u2019t imagine what I went through, it means I\u2019ve had experiences that have changed me and yet have made part of me fundamentally unknowable, even inaccessible, and disconnected from the person I was before. If that\u2019s the case, it means I never truly get to return home: I am forever cut off from the person I was before these wars.\nWhy do we build these memorials anyway? We do it to honor the dead, of course. We do it so veterans and their families will have a place to gather and remember. But there\u2019s something else, a less obvious reason but one I would say is most important. If a memorial is effective, if it\u2019s done well, anyone should be able to stand in front of it and, staring up, feel something of what I felt when my friend J.P. Blecksmith, 24, from Pasadena, was killed by a sniper in Fallujah on Veterans Day, 2004, or when Garrett Lawton, his wife and two young sons back home in North Carolina, was killed by an IED in Herat Province, Afghanistan. If civilians can feel that ache\u2014even a fraction of it\u2014they might start to imagine what it was like for us. And if they can imagine that, we come home.\n* * *\nA week after Memorial Day, I find myself on the phone with Michael \u201cRod\u201d Rodriguez, who leads the nonprofit Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, which is responsible for overseeing the fund-raising, design and construction of the national memorial, which is currently scheduled for completion in 2024. The foundation, Rod tells me, plans to have an open competition for the design, as was done with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. After a few minutes, Rod mentions that he served with Seventh Special Forces Group in Afghanistan. So did I. It turns out that we share many friends, and our interview is quickly derailed as we begin swapping war stories. I try to get us back on topic by asking him the purpose of the new memorial. \u201cWhat we were just doing,\u201d Rod replies. \u201cTalking about old times, remembering . It saves lives.\u201d\nRod emails me a map of the National Mall with about a half-dozen potential sites for the memorial, which will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, whose mission is to protect the dignity of public space in the nation\u2019s capital. Although real estate on the National Mall is precious, as of this writing four other war memorials are being planned for its grounds, commemorating the First World War, the Gulf War, Native American veterans and African-Americans who fought in the Revolution. And this doesn\u2019t include a planned expansion of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which will add an underground visitors\u2019 center, and the addition of a wall to the Korean War Veterans Memorial etched with the names of the 36,000 service members killed in that conflict.\nThe pace of construction on the Mall over the last three decades is remarkable, particularly considering that for the first 200 years of our nation\u2019s history\u2014which included nine major wars\u2014not a single major war memorial existed on the Mall. What a society chooses to commemorate says a great deal about that society. Most of our national memorials are dedicated to our wars. Which raises a question: Is the National Mall turning into a kind of symbolic national graveyard?\nOf course, one can certainly argue for the central role of these memorials in our capital, because none of our other accomplishments are possible without the freedom that our military has assured. But you need look no further than your own reflection in the shiny black granite of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to understand that many of our wars are self-inflicted wounds.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that we should commemorate only \u201cmorally good\u201d wars, such as the Civil War or the Second World War. Those might be the conflicts we least need reminding of. It\u2019s the more problematic wars in Vietnam, Korea, and, yes, Iraq and Afghanistan we need to memorialize in the most prominent spaces, lest future generations, while celebrating our successes, forget our mistakes.\n* * *\nSeth Moulton, a friend from the Marines, is now a congressman representing Massachusetts\u2019 Sixth District. Along with Representative Mike Gallagher, from Wisconsin, Seth was an original sponsor of the bipartisan Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act. I got in touch with Seth in Washington, D.C. and, with the memorial\u2019s potential sites saved to my phone, we set out for a run on the Mall.\nWe meet in front of the Longworth House Office Building early on a Wednesday morning. It\u2019s late July, muggy and hot. Seth wears an old desert-brown Under Armour shirt from his Iraq days. We jog west on the south side of the Mall, skirting the vast lawn along with the other joggers as we progress toward the Lincoln Memorial. Seth asks which of the memorials on my trip had resonated the most, and I confess that perhaps it was Murfreesboro: There was something honest about the places and names etched into stone. \u201cA memorial like that isn\u2019t really open to interpretation,\u201d I say.\nWe huff past the World War II Memorial, with its swooping eagles clutching laurels in their talons and epic bas-reliefs conveying the drama of a vast struggle fought across continents. \u201cIn another life,\u201d says Seth, \u201cI would have liked to have been an architect.\u201d\nI ask him how he would design the Global War on Terrorism Memorial.\n\u201cIt should be something that begins with idealistic goals, and then spins off into a quagmire,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will need to be a memorial that can remain endless, as a tribute to an endless war.\u201d\nA memorial to an endless war is an interesting prospect. It\u2019s been said that war is a phenomenon like other inevitable, destructive forces in nature\u2014fires, hurricanes\u2014although war is, of course, a part of human nature. Perhaps for the right artist, it will be an opportunity to make the truest war memorial possible, a monument to this fault in our nature.\nIf I had my way, I would get rid of all the war memorials and combine them into a single black wall of reflective granite, like Maya Lin\u2019s design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I\u2019d place the wall around the Reflecting Pool, beneath the long shadows of the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, the wall descending into the earth like something out of Dante. Etched into the wall would be names, and the very first would be Crispus Attucks, a black freeman shot dead by redcoats at the Boston Massacre, not far from the Old North Church. From there the wall would slope downward, each death taking it deeper into the earth, the angle of its descent defined by 1.3 million names, our nation\u2019s cumulative war dead.\nThe wall itself would be endless. When a new war began, we wouldn\u2019t erect a new monument. We wouldn\u2019t have debates about real estate on the Mall. Instead we\u2019d continue our descent. (If there\u2019s one thing you learn in the military, it\u2019s how to dig into the earth.) Deeper and deeper our wars would take us. To remember the fresh dead, we would have to walk past all the ones who came before. The human cost would be forever displayed in one monumental place, as opposed to scattered disconnectedly across the Mall.\nThe memorial would have a real-world function, too: Imagine if Congress passed legislation ensuring that every time a president signed a troop deployment order, he or she would have to descend into this pit. There, beside the very last name\u2014the person most recently killed in defense of this country or its interests\u2014there would be a special pen, nothing fancy, but this pen would be the only pen by law that could sign such an order.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m picturing as Seth and I arrive at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\u201cRun to the top?\u201d I ask him.\n\u201cNot all the way,\u201d he says, \u201cjust two-thirds,\u201d explaining that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s right to jog on such hallowed ground. We wander inside the vestibule. Seth grows quiet. When I ask if he wants to continue our run, my voice echoes against the stone.\nSoon we\u2019re back outside, running down the stairs. \u201cI love the Lincoln,\u201d Seth says as we head east, toward the Capitol and past the memorials for Korea and for Vietnam. We talk about what our memorial will mean, the effect we hope it will have on our generation of veterans, and how we hope that one day we\u2019ll be able to take our children to a memorial that conveys with sufficient emotion the experience not only of our war, but of war itself.\nOn our left we pass a duck pond. A layer of green sludge, maybe a centimeter thick, coats its surface. A dozen or so ducks, a squad\u2019s worth, paddle through a quagmire of slime. One at a time they follow each other into the sludge and then determinedly try to keep together as they cross. A few seem stuck. We watch them as we run past. It\u2019s a strangely grotesque sight in an otherwise pristine space."], "citation_links": ["https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-should-memorialize-those-lost-war-terror-180971006/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_fc94d023-0b18-4150-b9ba-d6bfa775c437"}

The amalgamation of her soulful 1970s vocals, bouffant hair, and thick cat-eye makeup gave her a commanding presence that helped thrust her into the music scene in the early aughts. The UK songstress was able to make a splash by blending soul, jazz, and hip-hop into pop hooks, and her public persona \u2013 and the controversy that surrounded it \u2013 helped turn her into a household name.\nDespite battling personal issues and tumultuous relationships in the media, Winehouse made an enormous impact on the music scene throughout her short life. And it wasn\u2019t ignored: For her 2007 album Back to Black , she amassed six Grammys \u2013 including Album of the Year \u2013 for her brutally honest, self-critical songwriting and expressive vocals. From musing about her turbulent love life to arguing about why she won\u2019t go to rehab, Winehouse produced a melancholic, sexy, and self-confident catalog of pop songs that have remained timeless.\nExplore Amy \u2019 s iconic discography on vinyl and scroll down for our Top 20 Amy Winehouse songs.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile Amy Winehouse had dropped her debut album Frank in 2003, it wasn\u2019t until the release of her 2006 sophomore LP Back to Black that the singer-songwriter had landed her first Top 10 hit. Part of what made Winehouse such an alluring artist was her unwavering candor, and her first Top 10 single, \u201cRehab,\u201d offered just that. Winehouse\u2019s fervent defiance about her substance issues paired with her syrupy pop hooks helped \u201cRehab\u201d land at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Winehouse\u2019s momentum took over with \u201cYou Know I\u2019m No Good,\u201d which quickly became a radio staple. The buzzy track \u2013 which magnified the self-loathing and desolation she found herself in as her relationship went from bad to worse \u2013 earned praise for its brassy vocals and playful horns, as well as a spot at No. 77 on the Hot 100 chart.\nInspired by the split from her then-husband, \u201cBack to Black\u201d finds Winehouse spiraling into nihilistic abandon but wrapped in 60s girl group harmonies and symphonic strings.\nAmy Winehouse - Back To Black\nClick to load video\nLeaning into the Motown sound, Winehouse crafted the fourth single from Back to Black around the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell\u2019s 1967 classic \u201c Ain\u2019t No Mountain High Enough \u201d for the wistful, mid-tempo \u201cTears Dry On Their Own.\u201d While her final single, \u201cLove Is a Losing Game,\u201d marked the culmination of her heartache, but it has since lived on as a favorite for artists like Prince and Sam Smith to cover in the years since her passing.\nNot every artist can pull off the art of making a cover as good (if not better than) the original. But Winehouse\u2019s gritty, powerhouse vocals and charm pulled it off. With \u201cValerie\u201d \u2013 a song originally recorded by English indie rockers The Zutons in 2006 \u2013 it was near-impossible to believe that the song wasn\u2019t her\u2019s, let alone Mark Ronson\u2019s cover with an assist from Winehouse. Thanks to the singer\u2019s bluesy vocals, Winehouse and Ronson\u2019s rendition of \u201cValerie\u201d soared to No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 2007.\nThough Winehouse could make any cover sound like it came straight out of Phil Spector\u2019s studio, she did rework a girl group classic with her cover of The Shirelles\u2019 \u201cWill You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\u201d The singer\u2019s ability to make a classic sound like an original was once again put front-and-center with the stripped-down rendition of the track in 2004.\nMark Ronson and Amy Winehouse - Valerie (Live at The BRIT Awards 2008)\nClick to load video\nFor the deluxe version of Back to Black , Winehouse delivered a slow-burning ska cover of Sam Cooke\u2019s 1961-penned track \u201cCupid\u201d that was a departure from the R&B-tinged pop songs she had become synonymous with.\nHer final single before her passing was a twist on Leslie Gore\u2019s 1963 pop hit \u201cIt\u2019s My Party,\u201d which appeared on Quincy Jones\u2019 compilation album Q: Soul Bossa Nostra . Backed by bold horns, Winehouse reworked the track\u2019s vocals to have even more of an overdramatic flair backed by bold horns.\nThroughout her brief career, she perfected the art of the kiss-off, as the best Amy Winehouse songs attest. Whether it was a cheating ex or someone trying to tell her what to do, the singer never held back her feelings. \u201cBetween the Cheats\u201d \u2013 a song from Winehouse\u2019s posthumous collection Lioness: Hidden Treasures \u2013 is an impassioned, doo-wop-soaked ditty filled with contempt for a cheating lover and Winehouse\u2019s crippling despair.\nBut years before this track was released, Winehouse proved she was wise beyond her years with the biting \u201cStronger Than Me,\u201d as she laments an older lover who isn\u2019t the kind of partner who can take care of her.\nAs a foil to \u201cStronger Than Me,\u201d Winehouse admits to having her ego bruised when she met the same, older man on \u201cYou Sent Me Flying.\u201d But the song is a standout for how Winehouse was able to put her own spin on the traditional piano ballad, adding hip-hop flair to the beat.\nAmy Winehouse - Stronger Than Me\nClick to load video\nThe smoky, gospel-tinged \u201cUnholy War\u201d is Winehouse\u2019s stream of consciousness at work as she details the helplessness she felt while watching her husband battle his own mental health issues.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the UK-exclusive single, \u201cIn My Bed\u201d sampled Nas\u2019 2002 hit \u201cMade You Look\u201d to create an R&B track flanked with brass about two lovers who can only agree when they\u2019re in bed. Winehouse\u2019s affinity for Nas is a throughline in her career. On \u201cMe & Mr. Jones,\u201d Winehouse concedes to being one of the rapper\u2019s many side-chicks and despite that, still remains loyal to him.\nWinehouse was clearly a student of jazz and hip-hop and her playful way with words reflected her love for both. Her jazz-inspired phrasing and antagonistic spirit made her many fans in the hip-hop community as the Lioness tracklist indicates, featuring contributors like Mos Def, Ghostface Killah, Jay-Z , and more.\nThough she wasn\u2019t officially credited, Winehouse also lent her vocals to Mutya Buena\u2019s single \u201cB Boy Baby\u201d in 2007, which borrowed melodies and lyrics from The Ronettes\u2019 \u201cBe My Baby.\u201d The two shared a common collaborator, with Salaam Remi producing the former Sugababe\u2019s debut album.\nWhile Winehouse\u2019s lithe vocals were posthumously featured on Nas\u2019 2012 track \u201cCherry Wine\u201d after her passing, the video featured images of Winehouse projected onto a bar wall and the song earned a Grammy nod for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2013.\nLike Smoke\nClick to load video\nUnsurprisingly, the first single from the posthumous collection of Winehouse\u2019s work was another song with Nas, \u201cLike Smoke.\u201d While the rapper takes the lead on the mid-tempo hip-hop track, Winehouse\u2019s theatrical flourishes hang off the chorus.\nWhile many of the best Amy Winehouse songs spoke of romance gone wrong, co-dependency and addiction, she also had a wicked sense of humor that shone through many of her self-deprecating lyrics.\nWinehouse pokes fun at herself for her love of weed in the drum-flanked \u201cAddicted.\u201d There\u2019s a playfulness to how she conflates her desire with weed to sex that allows Winehouse to let herself not be taken so seriously.\nOn the bouncy \u201cF__k Me Pumps,\u201d she uses her jazzy lilt to take a break from the ruminations of her mind to indict all the women who dress up just to chase Footballers at the club. Co-written by Rami and Winehouse, she joked the song was the result of \u201ctwo bi__hy people in one room.\u201d Winehouse could sling lyrical barbs with a certain dexterity, but she was often caught in her own crosshairs when it came to her lyrics.\nAmy Winehouse - Fuck Me Pumps\nClick to load video\nIn the short span of her life and career, Winehouse forged a soulful pop template that has spawned countless imitators, but there is only one Amy.\nListen to the best Amy Winehouse songs on Apple Music and Spotify.\nADVERTISEMENT"], "citation_links": ["https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/best-amy-winehouse-songs/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_8b7c0aaa-4f6b-4020-ad10-2fc2ec4001bd"}

A moderate weight range can depend also on your height.\nHow much does the average American man weigh?\nThe average American man 20 years old and up weighs\n. The average waist circumference is 40.2 inches, and the average height is just over 5 feet 9 inches (about 69.1 inches) tall.\nWhen broken down by age group, the average weights for American men are as follows:\n|Age group (Years)||Average weight (Pounds)|\n|20\u201339||196.9|\n|40\u201359||200.9|\n|60 and older||194.7|\nAs time wears on, American men are increasing in both stature and weight.\n, the average man weighed 166.3 pounds and stood at 68.3 inches (just over 5 feet 8 inches) tall.\nAmerican women are also reporting an increase in height and weight over time.\n, the average woman weighed 140.2 pounds and was 63.1 inches tall. By comparison,\nweighs 170.6 pounds, has a waist circumference of 38.6 inches, and is just under 5 feet 4 inches (about 63.7 inches) tall.\nHere\u2019s more about why this is happening and what you can do to keep your weight in a healthy range for your stature.\nThe average weight of people in the United States and North America as a whole is higher than any other region in the world.\nIn 2012, BMC Public Health reported the following average weights by region. The averages were calculated using data from 2005, and relied on combined statistics for men and women:\n- North America: 177.9 pounds\n- Oceania, including Australia: 163.4 pounds\n- Europe: 156.1 pounds\n- Latin America/Caribbean: 149.7 pounds\n- Africa: 133.8 pounds\n- Asia: 127.2 pounds\nThe world average for an adult\u2019s weight is 136.7 pounds.\nCompiling average weights is simple enough, but determining a healthy or ideal weight is a little more complicated.\nOne of the most common tools for this is the body mass index (BMI) . BMI uses a formula that involves your height and weight.\nTo calculate your BMI, divide your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared. Multiply that result by 703. You can also enter this information into an\n.\nTo know whether your BMI is normal or if it falls under another category, consult the information below:\nThe BMI isn\u2019t always a perfect tool to gauge whether your weight is in the healthy or normal range.\nAn athlete, for example, may weigh more than a non-athlete of the same height, but be in much better physical condition. That\u2019s because muscle is denser than fat , which contributes to a higher weight.\nGender is also a consideration. Women tend to store more body fat than men. Likewise, older adults tend to carry more body fat and have less muscle mass than younger adults of the same height.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reasonable estimate of an ideal weight for your height, consider the following table:\n|Height in feet and inches||Healthy weight in pounds|\n|4\u201910\u201d||88.5\u2013119.2|\n|4\u201911\u201d||91.6\u2013123.3|\n|5\u2032||94.7\u2013127.5|\n|5\u20191\u2033||97.9\u2013131.8|\n|5\u20192\u2033||101.2\u2013136.2|\n|5\u20193\u2033||104.5\u2013140.6|\n|5\u20194\u2033||107.8\u2013145.1|\n|5\u20195\u2033||111.2\u2013149.7|\n|5\u20196\u2033||114.6\u2013154.3|\n|5\u20197\u2033||118.1\u2013159|\n|5\u20198\u2033||121.7\u2013163.8|\n|5\u20199\u2033||125.3\u2013168.6|\n|5\u201910\u201d||129\u2013173.6|\n|5\u201911\u201d||132.7\u2013178.6|\n|6\u2032||136.4\u2013183.6|\n|6\u20191\u2033||140.2\u2013188.8|\n|6\u20192\u2033||144.1\u2013194|\n|6\u20193\u2033||148\u2013199.2|\nOne of the main limitations of BMI is that it doesn\u2019t take a person\u2019s body composition into consideration. A slim man and a broad-shouldered man of the same height may have very different weights but be equally fit.\nThere are other measurements that can give you a more accurate idea of whether or not you\u2019re at a healthy weight.\nOne such measurement is the waist-to-hip ratio . The waist-to-hip ratio is important because weight stored in the abdominal area puts you at a higher risk for certain health conditions, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes .\nMeasurements will be taken at your natural waist (right above your belly button) as well as the widest part of your hips and buttocks.\nIn 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a maximum waist-to-hip ratio of 0.90 for men and 0.85 for women. Ratios of 1.0 and 0.90, respectively, put men and women at high risk for health problems.\nDespite its overall usefulness, the waist-to-hip ratio isn\u2019t recommended for everyone. Some groups, including children and those with a BMI over 35, may find that other methods provide a more accurate assessment of their fitness.\nThere are a variety of ways to determine your body fat percentage, including skinfold thickness measurements and densitometry. Your doctor or a personal trainer may be able to perform these types of tests.\nOnline calculators can also use measurements such as your height, weight, and wrist circumference to estimate your body fat percentage.\nThe American Council on Exercise (ACE) , an organization for fitness professionals, uses the following classifications for male body fat percentage:\n|Classification||Body fat percentage (%)|\n|Athletes||6\u201313|\n|Fitness||14\u201317|\n|Acceptable/Average||18\u201324|\n|Obese||25 and up|\nMaintaining a healthy weight can help prevent a range of problems, such as:\nIf you need to drop a few pounds to get to your ideal weight, here are some key steps to help get you there:\nInstead of focusing on a large, big-picture goal, aim for a small goal. For example, instead of being set on losing 50 pounds this year, aim for losing a pound a week.\nYour diet should focus mainly on the following foods:\nLimit your consumption of added sugars , alcohol , and saturated fats .\nTry cutting your usual mealtime portions in half. If you typically have two slices of pizza on Saturday night, just have one and some salad. A food journal can help you track what and how much you\u2019re eating.\nAim for 30 to 40 minutes daily or at least 150 minutes per week. Your exercise regimen should include cardio , strength training , and flexibility exercises. You can also work out with a friend or family member to motivate you to get up and move.\nAlthough being 69.1 inches tall and weighing 197.9 pounds may be \u201caverage\u201d for an American man, that also indicates a BMI of 29.1 \u2014 the high end of the \u201coverweight\u201d classification. Average doesn\u2019t always mean ideal, at least in the United States.\nYou should also keep in mind that there are several different formulas and calculations used to determine ideal weight in relation to height. None of them are perfect. You may be just the right weight for your large frame, even though another measure may label you as overweight.\nHealthy weight isn\u2019t always a guarantee of good health. You can have a normal BMI, but if you smoke and don\u2019t exercise or eat right, you\u2019re still at risk for heart disease and other underlying conditions.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about your health, talk with your doctor .\nThey can help you understand where exactly your weight falls on the spectrum and how this may relate to your overall health. If needed, they can help set a good goal weight for you and work with you on strategies to get there.\nLast medically reviewed on February 27, 2019\nSources\nHistory"], "citation_links": ["https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/average-weight-for-men"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_e72280c7-fd78-4a3c-9cc4-d2c922fcfebd"}

On the Friday-night train journey he found himself surrounded by loud chattering gay men. He felt repelled. \u201cWhy did we all insist on sounding like a pack of braying ninnies?\u201d he thought to himself.\n\u201cI felt alienated from myself and from all the people around me, and the instrument of the alienation was our voice,\u201d he tells me over the phone from New York.\n\u201cI knew then that I had to get to the bottom of that feeling and to the importance of the voice as part of gay identity. As soon as I started speaking to my peers, I discovered that our voice was something that most, if not all, of us had thought about at some point and had anxiety about.\u201d\nIt was the start of a four-year journey of self-discovery during which Thorpe tried to figure out his so-called \u201cgay voice\u201d: when did he start talking that way, what caused it, how exactly did it sound, and, finally, what was so wrong with it anyway? The results can be seen in his new documentary, Do I Sound Gay?, which features interviews with linguists, academics, family and friends, as well as a number of high-profile personalities, including David Sedaris and Dan Savage.\nA high-pitched, lisping voice that goes up at the end has been part of the gay male stereotype for years. When Thorpe visits Susan Sankin, a speech pathologist, she identifies nasality, a lot of upspeak, a holding-on to words, and a sing-song pattern in his voice which she believes is the result of \u201ccode-switching\u201d. Simply, he has changed the way he talks to suit different occasions so much that he can\u2019t remember what he used to sound like. He insists he wants a \u201cnormal, unremarkable way of talking\u201d and he is given vocal exercises to practise.\nAnother expert that he interviews for the film is a Canadian linguist who studies vocal microvariations between gay and straight men and speculates that many gay men more readily pick up speech codes from women. Interestingly, a straight friend of Thorpe\u2019s has what is considered to be an archetypal \u201cgay voice\u201d and it turns that out he was raised entirely by women at an ashram.\nHaving no recordings of his voice from when he was younger, Thorpe goes to see his family members in South Carolina who claim that he didn\u2019t start speaking the way he does now until his first year at college, which is the same time that he came out. A friend suggests that he was \u201cadvertising\u201d his homosexuality, having kept it a secret for so long.\nElsewhere, the film looks at how the media might have affected his relationship with his voice. When he was younger, Thorpe notes, the only \u201cgay voices\u201d on television were those belonging to figures such as Liberace and Charles Nelson Reilly, the host of The Match Game. He also wonders if Disney villains such as Aladdin\u2019s Jafar and The Lion King\u2019s Scar, with their soft, threatening voices, have made young people associate sounding gay with being evil. It pleases him to hear so many more \u201cgay voices\u201d represented today, especially young vloggers such as Lohanthony and Tyler Oakley.\n\u201cThe film is a moment in my life where I don\u2019t have confidence for a number of reasons,\u201d Thorpe says. \u201cGrowing up, I was always told that what was wrong with me was that I was gay, so it\u2019s not hard to understand that in a moment of vulnerability I might also feel insecure about my sexuality. And my voice is probably the biggest signifier of that.\u201d\nAs for taling\u201dnormally\u201d, Thorpe has given up the exercises now and has embraced his voice.

In essence, the U.S. Government was concerned by, not just Che the man, but what he proselytized on insurgency and instability. He was the Osama Bin Laden of the 1960s.\nChe\u2019s image has transcended reality to that of a romantic hero. But ask any Cuban exile in the United States today and they will say that Che was simply a ruthless Communist revolutionary . 2 Best known for his brutality in Cuba, he was deeply involved in unsuccessful insurgencies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Bolivia. While not a thorough account of his life, this article summarizes Che\u2019s youth, idealism, and the revolutionary path that led him to Bolivia.\nErnesto was born on 14 May 1928 in Rosario, Argentina, to Ernesto Guevara Lynch and Celia de la Serna . 3 The first of five children, he was raised in an upper middle class family. His father was related to one of South America\u2019s most established families. While he squandered an inheritance, his wife, Celia, had her own and an estate that provided a small yearly income. Ernesto\u2019s upbringing was bohemian; as a boy he was free to do as he wished. But he was born with a serious, lingering ailment.\nFrom the age of two Ernesto suffered from severe asthma, forcing the family to live in a dry region. His father complained that \u201ceach day we found ourselves more at the mercy of that damned sickness. \u201d 4 The asthma made the often-bedridden Ernesto a voracious reader. He was also determined to lead an active life.\nErnesto played sports and engaged in daredevil antics to impress his friends. Although of slight build, he was especially good at rugby. His bohemian eccentricities earned him nicknames, the most unflattering being \u201c Chancho \u201d (pig), because Ernesto did not bathe regularly and wore unwashed clothes for weeks. Despite his nonconformity, Guevara chose to study medicine at the University of Buenos Aires and explore the country.\nOn his trips Guevara noticed the vast differences in living standards between the rural population and his social class. These forays into the countryside manifested a feeling of pan-Americanism, a desire to help the poor, and reinforced his hatred of the landed aristocracy in South America and the U.S. Despite being bourgeois, he held them responsible for Latin America\u2019s oppressed indigenous population. The adventure that most influenced the 24-year-old Ernesto began in January 1952. Partnered with Alberto Granado, he traveled through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, and the United States . 5 After nine months of travel and discovery, Ernesto was infused with a newfound sense of direction. He returned to Buenos Aires and completed his medical studies in April 1953.\nThe newly minted doctor once again took to the open road. After observing firsthand the results of the 1952 Bolivian Revolution in La Paz, he left for Guatemala to support the socialist president, a former Army officer named Jacobo Arbenz Guzm\u00e1n. There, Ernesto met his future wife, Hilda Gadea and got the nickname, \u201cChe,\u201d from Cuban political exile Antonio \u201c\u00d1ico\u201d L\u00f3pez who made fun of him for constantly using the Argentine expression che [hey!] . 6 The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) orchestrated overthrow of President Arbenz in 1954 had a profound effect on Che Guevara. Afterwards, he looked back on Guatemala as a revolution that could have succeeded if those in power had been more forceful.\nArbenz\u2019s populism, especially land reform and cooperation with Socialists, attracted international attention. In 1954, two percent of Guatemala\u2019s population owned 72 percent of the arable land. Since only 12 percent of that land was being used annually, Arbenz wanted to redistribute the rest. This did not please the powerful and influential U.S.-based United Fruit Company (UFC), which was Guatemala\u2019s largest landowner. In the midst of a \u201cRed Scare,\u201d Washington responded to the UFC\u2019s pleas for help, in part because America was not keen on a left-leaning government in the Western Hemisphere. Thus, the CIA trained a force in Nicaragua to overthrow Arbenz.\nOn 18 June 1954, nearly 500 men commanded by Carlos Castillo Armas crossed the border in four groups. Although the CIA-trained rebels were dealt severe blows, the revolt of the Guatemalan Army enabled final success. Arbenz was forced into exile. Those suspected of Socialist sympathies were arrested. Che took refuge inside the Argentine Embassy before fleeing to Mexico City.\nChe\u2019s revolutionary colleagues from Guatemala joined him there. \u00d1ico L\u00f3pez introduced him to Fidel Castro, whom Che thought was \u201cintelligent, very sure of himself and of extraordinary audacity; I think there is a mutual sympathy between us. \u201d 7 When Castro invited him to join the 26th of July Movement, Che accepted.\nCastro\u2019s movement was the cause Che had been seeking. The group began to covertly train under the tutelage of Spanish Civil War veteran Alberto Bayo. His paramilitary regimen included revolutionary war theory, physical conditioning, hand-to-hand combat, and marksmanship. Castro did not delay his return to Cuba.\nOn 25 November 1956, 82 guerrillas boarded the Granma, an old, leaky, cabin cruiser loaded down with weapons and supplies bound for Cuba. After a rough voyage, the small force landed on 2 December at Playa Las Coloradas . 8 Their first contact with Batista\u2019s forces on 5 December was disastrous. The Army attacked the guerrillas while they were resting in a sugar cane field. Surprised, the confused group did not put up an organized defense, and many fled through the dense sugar cane. Those who tried to fight were either killed or captured. Che, Castro, and Castro\u2019s brother Ra\u00fal, were among the few that managed to escape.\nThe twenty-plus survivors congregated in the safety of the Sierra Maestra Mountains . 9 Reunited, they began recruiting anti-Batista farmers. Once the urban underground cells of the 26th of July Movement discovered that there were Granma survivors, arms, supplies, and money trickled into the remote mountain camps. Hit and run attacks on small outlying garrisons garnered more. As the number of successful attacks grew, the group gained sympathy throughout Cuba. Castro capitalized on this by granting an exclusive interview to Herbert Matthews of the New York Times .\nA sympathetic Matthews greatly exaggerated the number of guerrillas to \u201cthousands.\u201d \u201cGeneral Batista cannot possibly hope to suppress the Castro revolt. \u201d 10 The interview showed that Havana\u2019s claims that Castro was dead were untrue. Recruits and support poured into the mountain retreats. By surviving and sticking with Castro, the Argentine proved his loyalty and dedication.\nChe\u2019s fervent belief in the revolution set him apart and added to his credibility among the Cubans as a Granma veteran. Although recruited as a doctor, his leadership and organizational skills prompted Castro to promote him to Comandante and give him command of one of the two rebel columns [at that time, Castro was the only other Comandante ]. Fidel needed his skills in the brutal struggle.\nDesperate to save his regime, Batista sent large forces into the mountains. While the rebels rarely killed enlisted soldiers who surrendered, captured insurgents expected little mercy. Castro\u2019s men were brutal with deserters. Poor living conditions made that a serious threat. Those caught were summarily tried and executed. The war quickly spread beyond the mountains.\nThe 26th of July Movement expanded guerrilla operations to assassinating prominent government supporters such as police and military officers. Batista launched \u201cOperation Verano,\u201d into the Sierra Maestra in late June 1958 in response. The six-week offensive was a disaster. It was such a large psychological victory that Castro expanded combat operations into the lowlands. Che took his column down to build alliances with other resistance groups.\nUnder pressure from the loosely united guerrilla groups, Batista\u2019s forces gave ground in late December 1958. Che\u2019s column secured numerous towns and defeated several garrison elements. The insurgency achieved success after capturing Santa Clara. Joined by Camilo Cienfuegos\u2019s column, the united guerrillas approached the city. Their 300-350 troops faced 3,500 of Batista\u2019s thoroughly demoralized soldiers.\nThe rebels secured the city after a series of brief engagements. When the Army fled, the way to the capital Havana, was open. Less than twelve hours after the fall of Santa Clara, Batista\u2019s government collapsed. He escaped to the Dominican Republic on 1 January 1959. The victorious rebels rolled into Havana unopposed and took control of government buildings. Che installed himself in La Caba\u00f1a, an 18th Century fortress turned prison where he presided over \u201crevolutionary tribunals\u201d of \u201cwar criminals\u201d until June 1959.\nSeveral thousand people were tried at La Caba\u00f1a. They were either sentenced to prison or executed. Former government officials, police, and army personnel who had served Batista were rounded up. Luis O. Rodriguez, a former platoon sergeant that fought in the Sierra Maestra, was arrested at home. Rodriguez described these dreadful times.\n\u201cthings were very disorganized \u2026 every night they would come in with a list \u2026 if you were called in [late at night/early morning] it would mean that you were going to trial. They would tell you not to carry anything with you. [This was] contrary to if they called your name during the day and would ask you to bring your belongings if you had anything. You knew you would be transferred \u2026 But if you were called during the night it was a different thing. You knew that your life was almost gone \u2026 After they called the names for about an hour or so nothing happened. Then, all of a sudden you heard the discharge of several rifles and after a few seconds \u2026 the single shots [coup de gr\u00e2ce], sometimes one, sometimes two \u2026 even four. All this time we saw Che \u2026 calling us criminals \u2026 he would say \u2018all you guys will end up the same way. You deserve it.\u2019 We were wondering why is this guy here, he was not even a Cuban \u2026 He was very arrogant and cold. \u201d 11\nThe trials shook the militaries of Latin America because large numbers of officers were summarily executed. The Cuban revolutionaries posed a threat to the professional military social class in the region. Bolstered by the success, Che began making bellicose public statements regarding insurgency and revolution.\nOn 27 January 1959 Che made his Social Projections of the Rebel Army speech. It was an ominous view of the future.\n\u201cThe revolution is not limited to the Cuban nation because it has touched the conscience of (Latin) America and seriously alerted the enemies of our peoples. The revolution has put the Latin American tyrants on guard because these are the enemies of popular regimes \u2026 the victory against the dictatorship is not a passing one but becomes the first step to the victory of (Latin) America. \u201d 12\nCuba had already begun to surreptitiously support revolutionary movements in the region, forcing nearby countries to fight internal threats. At the same time, the U.S. pressured Cuba because Castro was moving to nationalize American-owned economic assets.\nDomestically, Castro needed to build stability in Cuba. The executions at La Caba\u00f1a were stopped because they were attracting too much world attention. Che was sent on a three-month world tour ostensibly to garner support for the new revolutionary government and to promote sugar sales, Cuba\u2019s major export. When he returned, Guevara was kept busy as president of the National bank and manager of nationalized foreign assets. But, Che still managed to find time to broker stronger ties with the Soviet Union.\nOn 3 January 1961, the United States broke diplomatic ties with Cuba because of its appropriation of U.S.-owned properties without compensation and its turn to Socialism . 13 The Congressional quota of Cuban sugar purchased by the U.S. was abolished. That was the final impetus for Havana to move into the Soviet sphere. Russian small arms and tanks followed. Che deserved the lion\u2019s share of credit for this Soviet Cuban relationship . 14 As Minister of Industries, Che forged Cuba\u2019s economic policy\u2014despite lacking a background in business, industry, finance or government. CIA analysts assessed that this forced Castro afterwards to dedicate an inordinate amount of time to \u201cfinding remedies for the disastrous effects of the regime\u2019s early policies\u2014largely those engineered by Guevara. \u201d 15 Casto\u2019s \u201crevolutionary honeymoon\u201d was about to be upset.\nWith President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s approval, the CIA trained hundreds of anti-Castro Cubans to invade the island. The Brigade 2506 launched its disastrous invasion on 17 April 1961 at the Bay of Pigs ( Bah\u00eda de Cochinos ). The anticipated popular uprising did not occur. The newly elected president, John F. Kennedy, did not authorize U.S. military intervention and Castro\u2019s forces savagely counter-attacked . 16 Four days later, the fighting had ended and more than 1,100 were taken prisoner . 17 As the commander of forces in western Cuba, Che Guevara did not participate, but still taunted the Americans over the episode.\nIn August, while attending an Organization of American States (OAS) conference in Uruguay, Che requested a meeting with U.S. delegate Richard Goodwin. The diplomat told President Kennedy that Che \u201cwanted to thank us very much for the invasion\u2014that it had been a great political victory \u2026 and transformed them from an aggrieved little country to an equal. \u201d 18\nTensions between Havana and Washington worsened during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Although President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev averted the crisis, Che felt Soviet prestige was weakened . 19 Che revealed how radical he was a few weeks afterwards by telling British journalist Sam Russell that had Cuba controlled the missiles; he would have fired them off . 20 The U.S. had no choice but to consider Guevara a grave threat.\nChe continued his ranting on 11 December 1964 in the United Nations, when he lambasted the U.S. for its \u201cimperialist\u201d treatment of Latin America and the inequality shown its own minorities. He said, \u201cHow can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom? \u201d 21 Then surprisingly, Che outraged the Soviet Union in Algiers on 25 March 1965 when he called Moscow an accomplice \u201cof imperialist exploitation,\u201d for its trade policies with the developing world . 22 After becoming somewhat of an embarrassment to Havana, he privately renounced his rank, positions, and Cuban citizenship to Fidel Castro in order to foment revolution elsewhere . 23 Castro later released the letter. The unveiling insinuated that Guevara should not return to Cuba lest he have proof that his idealism and foco revolutionary theory worked. \u201cChe\u2019s whereabouts became the world\u2019s best-kept, most guessed-at secret,\u201d until his death in Bolivia in October 1967 . 24\nHe had already tried to sponsor focos in Latin America\u2014most notably in Argentina\u2014but the regime had been alerted and the insurgency quelled before it got started. Che then turned to Africa. There, the newly independent Democratic Republic of the Congo (from Belgium) had an ongoing internal rebellion that was receiving support from the Soviet Union and other Communist nations. To Che, the Congo \u201cwas one of the most important fields of battle,\u201d and an ideal place to test his foco theory . 25\n\u201cThis is a history of a failure\u201d was the first line that Che wrote in the preface to his Congo diary . 26 From April to November 1965, Che pushed his foco concepts, but was received indifferently. He blamed his lack of success on the African rebel leaders and troops, describing them as \u201ccorrupted by inactivity,\u201d lacking \u201crevolutionary awareness,\u201d and \u201clazy and undisciplined.\u201d They were \u201cthe poorest example of a fighter that I have ever come across. \u201d 27 But, he also learned that he had to be totally in charge of his next venture. This predilection proved fatal in Bolivia. Che went into seclusion to prepare for his next, hopefully better, expedition.\nMany U.S. intelligence analysts thought that Guevara was dead. Still, because of his stature, his proven support for armed Communist revolution, and connection to Fidel Castro, Washington had to be prepared to deal with him if/when he reappeared. Communist-insurgencies inspired by Che Guevara had to be eliminated. It was finally done in Bolivia.\n- Andrew St. George, \u201cHow the U.S. Got Che,\u201d True April 1969, 93.\n- Luis Rodriguez, interview by Dr. Troy J.

The education you receive there, and the attitudes you develop, will guide you for the rest of your life. Your grades will be especially important in landing your first job, or when applying to graduate school. To be a successful student requires certain skills; but, these are skills that can be learned .\nThe Basics of Being a Good Student\n- Prioritize your life: Doing well in school should be your top priority.\n- Study: There is no substitute.\n- Always attend class.\n- Do all of the homework and assigned reading.\n- Develop self-discipline.\n- Manage your time.\nSelf-Discipline Made Easy\nHuman beings are creatures of habit. Therefore, form a habit of doing what you reason you should do. Is it not foolish for your behavior to contradict your own reasoning? And what could be more harmonious than finding yourself wanting to do what you know you should?\nTrain yourself so there is an immediate reaction-mechanism within you:\nYou reason that you should do something, and thus you do it.\nOther people who seem to have less difficulty with self-discipline probably have simply had more practice at it, thereby making it less difficult; because, practice is what it takes.\nTime Management\nNo matter how you slice it, there are only 24 hours in a day. Good time-management requires:\n- Note taking on more than you can handle.\n- Reasonably estimating the time required to perform each of the tasks at hand.\n- Actually doing what needs to be done.\nOnly you can do these things. A couple of thoughts, though, that may help spur you on:\n- A minute now is as precious as a minute later. You can't put time back on the clock.\n- If you're not ahead of schedule, then you're behind schedule. Because, if you try to remain right on schedule, then any mishap or misjudgment will cause you to fall behind---perhaps right at the deadline, when no recovery is possible.\nIntrospection\n- Understand, and be honest with, yourself. All else follows from this.\n- Be both athlete and coach: Keep one eye on what you are doing, and one eye on yourself.\n- Take command of, and responsibility for, yourself.\n- Face your insecurities head-on. Some common signs of insecurity: Asking a question to which you already know the answer; being artificially social with instructors or other students, when the real reason is to temporarily kill the pain.\n- Form a positive self-image: Those students who are first entering college will probably have doubts about how well they will do. Try to do well immediately to instill an expectation of continuing to do well. Settle for nothing less. Nevertheless, try not be restricted by your past performance and experiences, good or bad. Learn from the past, but don't be bound by it. Seek out your weaknesses and attack them. Be realistic about your limitations; but, don't let this lead to becoming satisfied with them.\nTaking a Course\nEach student's attitude is some mixture of the following:\n- He/She wants to learn the material.\n- He/She wants to get a good grade.\n- He/She doesn't care.\nEach instructor's attitude is some mixture of the following:\n- He/She wants students to learn the material.\n- He/She wants grading to be fair and reflect students' knowledge and abilities.\n- He/She doesn't care.\nIn order to do well in a course, it is up to you (the student) to do two things:\n- Learn the material.\n- Learn the instructor.\nAs for the latter, pay attention in class to the instructor's patterns, to what he/she emphasizes, etc. Gather information about the instructor from other students. A good instructor, however, will present their course in such a way that it will be of little benefit for the student to try to learn him/her, thereby forcing their students to learn the material.\nHomework\n- Keep in mind that your work is being graded by a human being . Thus:\n- Write legibly, orderly, and coherently.\n- Supply any commentary necessary to make it clear what you are attempting to do.\nMaking the grader's job easier will more likely lead to you getting the benefit of doubt when it occurs.\n- Don't think that getting the right answer to a homework problem implies that you have mastered the corresponding material. All you have done is solve one particular problem; that does not mean you have necessarily learned how to solve all such problems (such as the ones to appear on your exams). It's up to you to view the homework problems from this wider perspective.\n- If available, always go over the solutions provided by the instructor, even if you did well on the assignment. He/She may demonstrate methods (perhaps more efficient) or provide useful information that you hadn't thought of.\nExams\n- Preparation:\n- Roughly prioritize material as to its importance (primary, secondary, tertiary), and concentrate your studying on the most significant topics. Remember, the instructor only has a limited amount of time to test what you know and can do. Thus, keep in mind when preparing for an exam that the problems cannot be too complicated if they are to fit within the allotted time.\n- Study in ways that are suited to you.\n- Study with a group or alone based upon which is really best for you.\n- Do your most strenuous and important work during those times of the day that you work best.\n- Summarize or outline the course or text material in your own words. Writing a summary not only forces you to examine the subject matter in detail, but provides a compendium to review just prior to the exam.\n- Play it safe: Memorize somewhat more than what the instructor says is required. Bring a calculator even if it's not suggested. Etc.\n- Study old exams if the instructor is known to give similar exams. But, don't be fooled into thinking that since you were able to work through an old exam, it means you understand all the course material in general, and can perform in a test situation.\n- Bring your own paper and a watch.\n- Fighting exam anxiety: Convince yourself that all you can do is all you can do; but, don't let that lead you to become complacent. Just be determined to be \"on\" for the duration of the exam. (Give yourself a pep-talk to this effect prior to each exam.)\n- Starting the exam:\n- Read the instructions thoroughly and carefully.\n- Skim over the entire exam prior to beginning work.\n- Don't necessarily do the problems in order. Instead, get those problems out of the way you feel confident you can do quickly and well. Observe how the problems are weighted, and direct your efforts to where you believe you can pick up points most easily. This does not necessarily mean attempting the most heavily weighted problem first; rather, it means first doing the problem for which you can accumulate points at the fastest rate . Indeed, there is a good chance that this is not the most heavily weighted problem, since many instructors dislike giving any one problem significantly greater or fewer points than the average, thereby underweighting the harder problems and overweighting the easier ones.\n- Before writing on any given problem, think . A small investment in time at the beginning can save time overall (for you might thereby choose a more efficient method of solving the problem).\n- Do precisely what is requested. In particular, don't waste time doing things that will not receive credit. For example, unless explicitly required, do not rewrite the exam problems on your paper.\n- Pace yourself through the exam. Example: On a 50-minute exam worth a 100 points, you should be accumulating 2 points per minute; thus, a 26-point problem should be completed in 13 minutes. Do this calculation at the start of the exam if the problem weights are given.\n- If only for psychological reasons, most graders use nonlinear grading by which the early points of a problem are easier to get:\nTherefore, always write something (meaningful) down for every problem, if only a little. At the other end, even with linear grading, there are diminishing returns in terms of points-per-effort in trying to squeeze every last point out of a given problem; if time is low, it may be better to move on.\n- Communicate with the grader. In particular, if you are running out of time, state the steps you would perform if you were to continue the problem.\n- Show your work and make clear your reasoning in order to have a chance to receive partial credit.\n- As with homework, and even more importantly, neatness counts.\n- In courses on subjective material (e.g., humanities), just regurgitate the material from class and the text(s). Supplying you own opinions may sound good in theory, but it has the risk of running counter to the opinions of the instructor or grader. Conversely, restatements of the class/text material are easy for the grader to recognize as something deserving credit. Remember: Unless the exam is multiple-choice, then a human being---who typically wants to grade the many exams in front of him/her as quickly and painlessly as possible---is doing the grading.\n- Always check over your answers if you have time.\nFurther Suggestions\n- Unify and simplify your knowledge: A textbook presents the subject in a particular form, as does an instructor. By their very natures, however, textbooks and lectures tend to present subjects sequentially. Take the extra step of understanding the material in your terms, which may involve recognizing relationships that could not be conveniently expressed in the order presented in the text(s) and lectures.\n- Remember, almost every logically consistent topic is simple at its foundation. Try to recognize the simple underlying relationships in the subject at hand; these are often left unstated by instructors and textbooks.\n- Try to learn general principles and methods. Learning by examples (putting the new in terms of the familiar) can only take you so far.\n- Learn as many methods of problem-solving as you can. This is especially helpful for exams, when time is of the essence.\n- Ask yourself questions. Why didn't the instructor or text(s) do this or that? Explore your own ideas. Try to understand the course material in detail .\n- It is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. Do you know the subject matter well enough to explain it clearly and completely to someone else?\n- Learn by observing others. Notice what works for them and consider incorporating those methods into yourself. Ask yourself \"Why didn't I think of that?\", and try to develop the related ability.\n- Attempt to be methodical, neat, legible, deliberate, precise, knowledgeable, and reliable on the one hand, and creative, spontaneous, imaginative, smart, clever, articulate, and flexible on the other. The first mentality thrives on order, and inherently tries to do well what it already knows how to do; the second mentality thrives on disorder, and inherently tries to expand upon its abilities. Adopt the best of these two mentalities. Remember, every tool is a potential crutch. The first mentality may rely too heavily on already-mastered skills; but, the second mentality may fail to carefully apply those same skills.\n- Think about and question everything, even the statements appearing here ( and , yourself!). But, realize that it is equally foolish to be different merely for the sake of being different, as it is to mindlessly conform to the norm.\n- For maximum efficiency, have several projects going at once. Then, if you get tired, frustrated, or bored working on one item, you can easily move onto something else, thereby staying productive as well as giving pending problems a chance to work themselves out subconsciously.\n- Anticipate. For example, you may need to ask the instructor about the present assignment, but he/she is only guaranteed to be available at certain times; therefore, you should look over the assignment early.\n- Forget pulling \"all-nighters\". These merely amount to borrowing from tomorrow, at which time you will find yourself considerably less functional. All-nighters are really an indication of not having properly planned your activities.\n- If possible, bring your textbook(s) to class.\n- Take your lecture notes in pencil, since any modifications can then be made quickly and neatly.\nClosing\nOverall, there is one basic trait that distinguishes successful students from those that are not:\nSuccessful students force themselves to understand.\nThey do not merely go through the motions of attending class, reading the text(s), and doing the homework, expecting these actions to necessarily suffice. Rather, they are continually asking, \"Do I really understand what's going on here?\" They ask this question of themselves honestly, applying an internal barometer formed from experience to detect the slightest lack of understanding, be it ignorance or confusion. And, if the answer is \"No\", then the situation is viewed as unacceptable, and more effort is the response.\nHow to Be a Good Student \u00a91997 Jerome R. Breitenbach.

Neither does this book. This story of the Federal Reserve is about good guys, bad guys, and self-serving politicians helping their rich and famous friends. Also interesting is Rothbard\u2019s discussion of nineteenth-century British case law that paved the way for fractional reserve banking. Rothbard points out that, with bailment law undeveloped in the nineteenth century, bankers were able to win three important court cases culminating with the Foley v. Hill and Others case in 1848. In this case, the House of Lords decided that bankers contract for an amount of money, but not necessarily to keep that particular money on hand.\nRothbard lays to rest the myth that the Panic of 1907 led to the creation of the Fed. Bankers began scheming for a central bank after William McKinley defeated William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election. Long gone were the days of the hard-money Jacksonian Democratic party, and the populist Democrat Bryan pushed for monetizing silver to increase the supply of money. Wall Street\u2019s bankers supported McKinley, not wanting inflation that they couldn\u2019t control.\nThe Panic of 1907 was used to whip up support for a central bank. But, it was the meetings of the Indianapolis Monetary Convention that started the political wheels turning, culminating in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in December of 1913.\nWith the system in place, all that was needed was the \u201cright\u201d man to control the money machine. In 1914, that man was Benjamin Strong, then president of J. P. Morgan-owned Bankers Trust and best friend of Morgan partners Harry P. Davison, Dwight Morrow, and Thomas W. Lamont.\nStrong ruled the Fed until his death in 1928. During World War I, he engineered a doubling of the supply of money, financing the U.S. war effort.\nThe continuous Fed propaganda is that a zealous public clamors for more inflation, and only the Federal Reserve\u2019s cool heads are standing in the way of a hyper-inflation armageddon. Of course, just the opposite is true. As Rothbard points out, \u201cThe culprit solely responsible for inflation, the Federal Reserve, is continually engaged in raising a hue-and-cry about `inflation,\u2019 for which virtually everyone else in society seems to be responsible. What we are seeing is the old ploy by the robber who starts shouting `Stop, thief!\u2019 and runs down the street pointing ahead at others.\u201d\nRothbard saves the fun part of dismantling the Fed for last. Liberty lovers are always being told that, \u201cyour ideas sound good, but how are you going to get there from here?\u201d Rothbard has given us simple directions for the Fed\u2019s liquidation.\nWith the Fed abolished, banks would be on their own; no more lender of last resort, or taxpayer bailouts. The inflation dragon would be slain. The boom-and-bust roller coaster ride leveled.\nThe Case Against the Fed is part history, part polemic, and part policy paper, succeeding with all three. Murray Rothbard has written another classic. []\nMr. French is a vice president in commercial real estate lending for a bank in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nBased on the following credentials, which of these two very real (but now deceased) people do you think would be most likely to excel in \u201curban planning,\u201d the practice of designing and developing land use, transportation, infrastructure, and other important elements of the building and management of cities?\nPerson A earned an undergraduate degree from Yale and another from Wadham College, a master\u2019s degree from Wadham, and a doctorate from Columbia University. From there, this person went on to hold more positions within the government of a major American metropolis than perhaps any other in its history\u2014supervising everything from parks to architecture to roads and bridges.\nPerson B earned just one degree, a high school diploma, and that\u2019s it. Never held a position within any city government, anywhere.\nIf you chose Person A, you might need to brush up on your F. A. Hayek. The famed Austrian School economist and Nobel laureate once cogently advised,\nThe curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account.\nUniversity degrees are still a kind of \u201cunion card\u201d for employment in some places. Perhaps they are a rough measure of information in one\u2019s head, but information should not be confused with wisdom . It was with good reason, after all, that William F. Buckley once noted that he would \u201crather live in a society governed by the first two thousand names in the Boston telephone directory than in a society governed by the two thousand faculty members of Harvard University . \u201d\nPerson A in my paradigm was Robert Moses (1888-1981), who wielded immense authority as an unelected New York City \u201cplanner\u201d for decades, and under administrations of both Democrat and Republican mayors. He is a perfect example of how power corrupts, for the longer he hung around, the more dismissive he was of dissenting opinions.\nHis \u201crenewal\u201d projects were punctuated with arrogance. When he used the city\u2019s eminent domain powers to wipe out whole neighborhoods, he spoke derisively of the citizens whose property he bulldozed. The \u201ccity\u201d in his mind was not composed of its living residents so much as the concrete structures he envisioned in their place. The residents were the city\u2019s \u201cjungles\u201d that he would use city government to \u201cclear out\u201d and cleanse.\nPerson B in my paradigm was Jane Jacobs (1916-2006), a heroine of urban culture if ever there was one. Incredibly intuitive and observant, as well as courageously outspoken, she knew cities from the bottom up. Whereas the \u201cwell-educated\u201d Robert Moses looked down on cities from above and saw jungle, Jacobs proved in her principled opposition to his grandiose plans that, in her words, \u201cThe real jungle is in the office of the bureaucrats.\u201d\nToday\u2014May 4, 2023\u2014marks the 107th anniversary of the birth of the remarkable Jane Jacobs. No one is an expert on cities if he isn\u2019t well aware of what she believed, what she wrote, and what she did.\nCitizen Jane: Battle for the City is a remarkable documentary video I encourage readers to watch. One of the many people interviewed in it neatly summarizes what Jacobs was all about:\nNever mind high-falutin\u2019 theories and so forth. What are we looking at? What are we seeing? Do you want to trust some theory that somebody figured out sitting in an office somewhere, or do you want to trust what you actually see out there with your own eyes? Maybe the experts didn\u2019t really know as much as they pretended to know.\nAt the height of his power and influence, Robert Moses ripped at the heart of New York City\u2019s vibrant and often ethnic enclaves. He devastated colorful street and sidewalk culture and erected lifeless hi-rise public housing in its place (which even its residents resented). He loved his bulldozers but Jacobs preferred people.\nIn one of the many public protests she helped organize, Jacobs wore a placard around her neck adorned in large letters with the message, \u201cConscience: the Ultimate Weapon!\u201d\nProfessionally, Jacobs was a journalist. Her competence derived not from any university degrees she bought, but from her street-savvy understanding of people and city life. She proved to be a brilliant strategist in taking on Moses when she led citizens in killing his plans to build a road through a beloved city park. When he proposed to construct an expressway across Lower Manhattan, forever blighting life in Greenwich Village and Soho, Jane Jacobs played the role of David to Moses\u2019 Goliath. It\u2019s an inspiring story of grassroots opposition that ultimately proved the emperor had no clothes.\nIn the name of \u201curban renewal\u201d and with the political pomp of its ribbon-cutting ceremonies, Jacobs implored us to examine the actual results of government bullies like Robert Moses:\nLook what we have built\u2026Low-income projects that become worse centers of delinquency, vandalism, and general social hopelessness than the slums they were supposed to replace. Middle-income housing projects which are truly models of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life. Luxury housing projects that mitigate their inanity, or try to, with a vapid vulgarity. Cultural centers that are unable to support a good bookstore. Civic centers that are avoided by everyone but bums\u2026Expressways that eviscerate great cities. This is not the rebuilding of cities. This is the sacking of cities.\nMy purpose in this essay is not to recount the famous battles between Jacobs and Moses in detail, but rather to mark her birthday with some of her most memorable insights and to encourage readers to look at her classic book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities . In the recommended readings below, you\u2019ll also find some excellent articles about her.\nI hope these selected Jacobs quotes will inspire many new readers of her work:\n\"There is nothing more inert than a government bureau. There is nothing more inert than a planning office. It gets going in one direction and it\u2019s never going to change of its own accord\u2026The citizens are going to have to frustrate the planners. I thereupon began to devote myself to frustrating planners, and so did the whole neighborhood.\"\n_____\n\"I was brought up to believe that there is no virtue in conforming meekly to the dominant opinion of the moment. I was encouraged to believe that simple conformity results in stagnation for a society, and that American progress has been largely owing to the opportunity for experimentation, the leeway given initiative, and to a gusto and a freedom for chewing over odd ideas.\"\n_____\n\"I was taught that the American\u2019s right to be a free individual, not at the mercy of the state, was hard-won and that its price was eternal vigilance, that I too would have to be vigilant. I was made to feel that it would be a disgrace to me, as an individual, if I should not value or should give up rights that were dearly bought. I am grateful for that upbringing.\"\n_____\n\"Extremists typically want to squash not only those who disagree with them diametrically, but those who disagree with them at all. It seems to me that in every country where extremists of the left have gotten sufficiently in the saddle to squash the extremists of the right, they have ridden on to squash the center or terrorize it also. And the same goes for extremists of the right. I do not want that to happen in our country.\"\n_____\n\"Advanced cultures are usually sophisticated enough or have been sophisticated enough at some point in their pasts, to realize that foxes shouldn\u2019t be relied on to guard henhouses.\"\n_____\n\"There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.\"\n_____\n\"The pseudoscience of planning seems almost neurotic in its determination to imitate empiric failure and ignore empiric success.\"\n_____\n\"The trouble with paternalists is that they want to make impossibly profound changes, and they choose impossibly superficial means for doing so.\"\n_____\n\"The first thing to understand is that the public peace\u2014the sidewalk and street peace\u2014of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves\u2026No amount of police can enforce civilization where the normal, casual enforcement of it has broken down.\"\n_____\n\"To see complex systems of functional order as order and not as chaos takes understanding. The leaves dropping from the trees in the autumn, the interior of an airplane engine, the entrails of a dissected rabbit, the city desks of a newspaper\u2014all appear to be chaos, but they are seen without comprehension. Once they are seen as systems of order, they actually look different.\"\n_____\n\"Historically, solutions to city problems have very seldom come from the top. They come from people who understand the problems firsthand because they\u2019re living with them and have new and ingenious and often very off-beat ideas of how to solve them.\"\n_____\n\"Under the seeming disorder of the old [pre-\u201curban renewal\u2019] city\u2026is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the street and the freedom of the city.

You can grill it or fry it and spice it up in any way that you may like, and it doesn\u2019t burn a hole through your wallet either! After all, chicken is healthy meat, expensive or cheap\u2026 Right? A trip down to the grocery store, made me take a deep dive into the differences between expensive (organic) and cheap (conventionally grown) chicken meat. I noticed that the conventional chicken meat had sold out a lot faster than the organic chicken meat, due to its lower prices, and despite the healthier labels on the organic chicken packages. The price of the conventional chicken was about $3 for one pound of the breast, and the organic chicken breast of similar weight was charged at about $7. I needed to understand why this striking difference in price and quality of the meat occurred. After doing some research, it is clear that while cheaper chicken meat is appealing to purchase, it comes with (detrimental) hidden costs that have disastrous effects on the environment, the working conditions in the chicken meat industry, and our very own health.\nWhen it comes to raising, handling, and slaughtering chickens in a conventional and less costly manner, the procedure differs from raising organic chickens. Cheaper priced and conventionally industrial chicken tends to be raised in harmfully inappropriate conditions. They are constantly fed genetically modified organisms (GMO) which are loaded with hormones and genetically modified corn and soy (Auld,2017). This modified feed tends to make the chickens grow fatter and faster, so they can sell quickly and at a good price. According to CountryFarm Lifestyle, these chickens have a short lifespan of about three to six months, before they get slaughtered (Country farm Lifestyle, n.d). This short lifespan of the chicken leads to the farmers being able to increase their turnover and revenues while selling more unhealthy meat. Furthermore, these chickens are chemically cleaned with chlorine after being slaughtered, versus regular organ sanitizer and iced water. Chlorine makes it impossible to detect any bacteria and salmonella in the meat, both of which are harmful to the human body (Soil Association, 2020). This chlorine-based technique approves the chicken meat for selling a lot faster and is a much cheaper method of cleansing the meat. Despite this unhealthy method of handling and slaughtering, a majority of consumers purchase the cheaper meat, as the organic chicken meat is too expensive in comparison and they falsely assume all chicken meat is healthy.\nA huge concern that gets raised when it comes to eating chicken, is the effect that it has on our health. Cheaper and more modified chickens carry significantly more fat than protein in their bodies. According to The Times , a lot of their meat is unhealthy and lacks nutrition. So, when consumers eat industrial chicken, they are consuming more fat than protein, which defeats the health purposes of eating chicken(Leake, The Times, 2019). \u201cEating industrial chicken that sells for cheap can lead to obesity, heart conditions, stomach ulcers, etc.,\u201d says Arnarson. According to Jonathan Leake from The Times , the fat from the chicken leads to the clogging of the arteries and increases our own body fat percentage. He sheds light on the fact that the chlorine used to clean these chickens tends to slowly erode our heart muscles over the years, which is the leading cause of heart issues related to industrial chicken consumption(Leake, The Times, 2019) . The hormones and feed of these chickens are modified with medications that do not sit well with our digestive systems and are the main cause of stomach ulcers as the bacterial content leads to h pylori, a bacterial infection that erodes the stomach lining (Arnarson, 2017). Shocking statistics show that industrial chicken can lead to a 12% higher risk of cancer and about 25% higher risk of heart diseases (Arnarson, 2017). While cheaper, conventional chicken meat is tastier and more filling for a lower cost, it comes loaded with hazardous side effects that are prone to harm our bodies and organs in innumerable ways.\nSo far, we have understood what goes into the raising of industrial chickens, and how their meat affects our bodies. Next, it\u2019s informative to understand the different labeling related to chicken packaging. Cheaper chicken usually doesn\u2019t have any fancy terms on the packaging, but it does come with the basic information about the nutritional value (sugar, Protein, carbs, sodium), of the chicken and the FDA approved stamp (Foster,2014). They also require the Animal Welfare Humane Certificate stamps (AWHC) in order to prove their eligibility for the humane treatment of the chicken.\nBoth of these are images of conventionally industrial chicken meat- they do not come with the labels that organic chicken packaging comes with.\nCHICKEN HANDLING AND LIVING CONDITIONS:\nWhile most people are ignorant about the living conditions of chickens, it\u2019s vital for people to realize how unethical and mortifying it is to see the way industrial chicken farmers handle their stock, versus the organic chicken farmers. Cheaper, more industrial chickens are usually put to live in tiny cages inside factory farms. These farms stock up to 20 chickens a cage (Country farm Lifestyle, n.d), which leads to the chickens not having enough space to flap their wings. This sometimes leads to the chickens getting violent and pecking each other with their beaks. As a result of this, breeders cut off chicken beaks to avoid them from pecking each other, which is considered illegal in many countries across the world as it is extremely painful and can be compared to genital mutilation (Country farm Lifestyle, n.d). Chickens tend to keep digging at the ground, which leads to them picking up diseases and infections and they start eating the dust due to high hunger levels. Due to the overcrowding in the sheds, there\u2019s low ventilation and the chickens often fall sick. They are pumped with hormones to grow faster and cannot support their own weight after a point, so they develop painful chronic diseases where they can\u2019t stand or walk. According to CountryFarm Lifestyle, these chickens and are slaughtered in under four months of their birth.\nMoving forward, I would now like to shed some light on how organic chickens are different from conventional chickens, and why. Our so-called organic chicken is fed 100% unmodified feed that doesn\u2019t contain growth hormones or any form of fattening agents, like GMOs (Auld,2017). According to Soil Association , these chickens are around for almost two years before they are slaughtered. After their death, they are rinsed with ice water and FDA certified sanitizers, despite it being a more expensive and time-consuming process (Soil Association, 2020). Their meat is all-natural and so is their feed. The high costs of breeding healthy chicken, are a large reason why multiple store owners across the country, prefer stocking cheaper, conventional chicken meat, as these high costs tend to get passed down to the storeowners.\nWhen compared to cheaper chicken meat, the more expensively priced packets of organic chicken, have different effects on our health. It is most certainly a better alternative as it has a higher protein content and a lower fat content. This is because of the difference in the chicken feed and the lack of modified elements in the feed of organically grown chickens. These chickens are also rinsed using unharmful liquids post their death, which prevents them from eroding our heart muscles (Arnarson, 2017). The overall risk of many illnesses like heart related diseases and obesity is lower when comparing organic chicken to industrial chicken. Organic chicken is also almost half as likely to be carrying Salmonella, in comparison to conventionally industrial chicken meat.\nOrganic and more expensive chicken packages come with different stamps. Some important ones to look for, that certifies it is more organic and healthier is the pasture-raised/pastured label: This refers to chicken that was raised on pastures and had access to edible vegetation, making it healthy. Organic chicken labels denote that the chicken was given feed that had no pesticides, chemicals, or antibiotics used to modify it (Foster,2014). Hormone and antibiotic-free labels ensure that neither hormones nor antibiotics were used to modify the chicken feed or the chicken itself, in any way. The \u201cnatural\u201d label on packages refers to the fact that the chicken contains no added color or artificial preservatives. 1005 Vegetarian Diet refers to the fact that the chicken ate vegetarian food all its life, and didn\u2019t consume any GMO. These labels signify the various healthy methods used to either feed or grow the chicken, which all industrial chicken packages lack. For this very reason, it is important to understand that organic chicken may be more expensive but comes with a lot of intricate precautions that industrial chicken meat lacks ( Foster,2014).\nThese are images of organic chicken packages that come with plenty of labeling.\nThe next comparison I would like to draw between industrial and organic chicken meat is the way organic chickens are raised and handled on the farm. chicken farmers let their chicken grow naturally over a period of almost two years. The chickens in cages have enough place to be comfortable and are let out on the farm occasionally. They eat the vegetation they can find, eliminating the risk of diseases and germs from consuming dust (Country farm Lifestyle, n.d). The vegetation they consume is natural as well, so the chickens tend to live peaceful and healthy lives. They are slaughtered after about two years of their birth and are cleaned with safe and certified substances, instead of chlorine.\nUltimately, I would like to talk about the effects that raising and breeding chickens have on our environment. Unfortunately, chicken breeding harms the environment on an overall basis. Chicken breeding on a whole releases greenhouse gases like Carbon Dioxide from burning fossil fuels and nitrous oxide from chicken manure.\nAnnual chicken breeding can produce over 129 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, which is the same amount as 12.37 million cars (Biological Diversity, n.d). Many farmers don\u2019t have enough space on their lands to dispose of manure, so they get rid of it through the surrounding waterways. The manure in the waterways tends to add nitrous oxide and phosphorous to it which leads to rapid algae growth. This leads to the creation of aquatic dead zones, where the water poison levels are so high that no life can survive the area. Apart from this, breeding chickens consume so much water, that if an average American consumer gave up one chicken breast a week, they would be able to save up to 4321 gallons of water a year and this is equivalent to flushing the toilet 2,700 times (Biological Diversity, n.d).\nAs American consumers, we often equate good price to good quality. However, when it comes to purchasing chicken, most consumers are under the disillusion that chicken meat is extremely nutritious and healthy, regardless of its price. Consumers assume that even the most inexpensive and basic quality chicken meat pieces will give them the protein they are looking for, without realizing that more expensive chicken is significantly healthier for various reasons and in numerous ways. Thus, it seems important that American Consumers understand the differences between industrial and organic chicken meat, in order to avoid any information asymmetry regarding the disparities in the two types of chicken meat.\nREFERENCES\nAssociation, S.

However, it is unclear how insects deal with sunlight in their eyes.", "references": ["The eyes of the chameleon provide 360-degree vision due to unique eye anatomy and an ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision.\nChameleons have a distinctive visual system that enables them to see their environment in almost 360 degrees (180 degrees horizontally and +/-90 degrees vertically). They do this in two ways. The first is with anatomical specializations that enable the eyes to rotate with a high degree of freedom. The second is the chameleon\u2019s ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision, meaning they can view objects with either eye independently, or with both eyes together.\nSeveral anatomical features enable chameleons to rotate their eyes to such a high degree. The eyes are located on opposite sides of the head, providing a view to the sides and behind or toward the front. Internally, the eye balls are mounted in twin conical turrets (like two upside down ice cream cones). Without a deep orbital socket to keep the eye from falling out (as in humans), the chameleon has evolved a thick, muscular lid. This lid surrounds each eye turret, leaving only the pupil exposed. This provides a \u201csafety net\u201d that enables the eye to bulge out of the conical turret. Without the restriction of a deep orbital socket, each eye can rotate nearly 180 degrees, giving a much wider range of vision than animals whose eyes are secured in socket structures.\nPermission provided by Tanalahy.com for use on AskNature.org.\nThe ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision also enables the chameleon to view objects panoramically. While searching for prey, the chameleon uses monocular vision, with each eye functioning independently of the other. The eye movements\u2013or saccades\u2013are referred to as \u2018uncoupled\u2019 when functioning this way. Two separate bundles of nerves control the musculature of the eyes, and two separate images are sent to the brain. Once the chameleon spots its prey, the saccades synchronize, in a process called \u201ccoupling,\u201d and both eyes lock on the object. For coupling to occur, visual signals are first sent to the brain through two non-coupled neural bundles. The brain reads these signals, and the eye that has spotted the prey sends stronger electrical impulses to the brain than the eye still searching for the target. The neuron from the eye that does not see the prey syncs with the one that does, forming a larger neural bundle. Once the eye movements are synchronized, the eyes fix on the object and only the head rotates.\nThe chameleon\u2019s ability to switch freely between synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye movement is like having two movies playing in your head, and if you wanted to only watch one, you could. This enables the chameleon to operate as both a binocular and monocular organism in a remarkably efficient way for protection, food gathering, and reflexes.\nThis summary was contributed by Allie Miller."], "citation_links": ["https://asknature.org/strategy/eyes-give-360-vision/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_39321dfa-41d3-4c54-81b5-5c7a3f96e7cc"}

Newsweek has everything you need to know.\nFirst to take to the American Idol stage was HunterGirl, who performed Underwood's \"Undo It,\" followed by Little Big Town's \"Girl Crush.\"\nHunterGirl has been a strong contender for the final since the beginning of American Idol after being handed the exclusive platinum ticket by judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan.\nAmerican Idol fans will remember the platinum ticket that gave HunterGirl a head start at Hollywood week and clearly identified her as one to watch.\nAfter the live show, HunterGirl posted on Instagram a photo from the live show, telling her followers she had \"cried\" so much after making it through to the Top 3.\nShe wrote: \"I MADE IT TO THE FINALE!!! I have cried so hard. Thank you guys so much for believing in me. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH!\nNoah Thompson, the only male singer in this year's final, performed Underwood's hit \"So Small\" for his first song and for his second performance, wowed the audience with his rendition of \"Working Man\" by Larry Fleet.\nThankfully, Thompson was allowed out of quarantine after he had COVID during last week's show and he didn't have to perform from his hotel room this time around.\nTaking to Twitter shortly after the live show ended, Thompson thanked his fans for voting for him.\nHe wrote: \"Came into this competition scared out of my mind, it's all so surreal. I have no words man. You guys mean the absolute world to me, thank you for everything!! Cannot believe this right now.\"\nLeah Marlene was the third act confirmed to make it into American Idol's Top 3. It was between her, Fritz Hager, and Nicolina, and when Leah's name was called, she fell down onto the stage floor in complete shock.\nHer performances of \"I'll Stand By You\" by The Pretenders and Journey's \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\" was enough to win America's hearts and votes and she will be competing for the top spot next week.\nHager returned to the stage after missing last week's live episode due to COVID isolation and performed Underwood's song \"I Wanna Remember,\" followed by \"Youngblood\" by 5 Seconds of Summer.\nNicolina gave an amazing performance of \"Blown Away\" by Underwood, followed by Adele's \"All I Ask,\" but unfortunately for them both, their performances weren't enough to win America's votes.\nThe American Idol finale will air Sunday, May 22 at 8 p.m. on ABC"], "citation_links": ["https://www.newsweek.com/american-idol-top-3-2022-acts-final-huntergirl-noah-thompson-leah-marlene-1706835"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_755dbd94-5a52-4689-ba43-f1aa20cbd9aa"}

Ultimately, the decision to convert salary to bonuses depends on each athlete's individual financial situation and goals.", "references": ["At Bankrate we strive to help you make smarter financial decisions. While we adhere to strict , this post may contain references to products from our partners. Here's an explanation for .\nA bonus is always a welcome bump in pay, but it\u2019s taxed differently from regular income. Instead of adding it to your ordinary income and taxing it at your top marginal tax rate, the IRS considers bonuses to be \u201csupplemental wages\u201d and levies a flat 22 percent federal withholding rate.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how bonuses are taxed.\nThe IRS considers bonuses to be \u201csupplemental wages.\u201d A supplemental wage is money paid to an employee that isn\u2019t part of his or her regular wages, according to the IRS.\nIn general, bonuses of any kind, including signing bonuses and severance pay, fit into the supplemental wages category. Other examples of supplemental wages include, but aren\u2019t limited to:\n- Accumulated sick leave.\n- Certain commissions.\n- Overtime pay.\n- Prizes and awards.\n- Back pay.\n- Reported tips.\n- Retroactive pay increase.\n- Payments for non-deductible moving expenses\nJust as your employer holds back a portion of your regular paycheck to prepay your taxes, it must take money out of your bonus check, too. These funds are sent to the IRS on your behalf. This process is known as tax withholding .\nWhen it comes to bonuses, employers are allowed to calculate your tax withholding in one of two ways: the percentage method or the aggregate method.\nThe percentage method, also called the flat rate method, is the easiest way for employers to calculate taxes on a bonus. It often results in more money in your pocket, at least initially.\nWhen an employer taxes your bonus using the percentage method, it must identify the bonus as separate from your regular wages. The withholding rate for supplemental wages is 22 percent. That rate will be applied to any supplemental wages like bonuses up to $1 million during the tax year. If your bonus totals more than $1 million, the withholding rate for any amount above $1 million increases to 37 percent.\nBelow are two examples of how the percentage method works.\nExample 1:\n|Bonus amount||$10,000|\n|Federal tax||$10,000 X 22% = $2,200 federal income taxes withheld|\n|Remaining bonus||$7,800|\nExample 2:\n|Bonus amount||$1.5 million|\n|Federal tax||$1 million X 22% = $220,000 $500,000 X 37% = $185,000$220,000 + $185,000 = $405,000 federal income taxes withheld|\n|Remaining bonus||$1,095,000|\nNote: If your supplemental wages for a year total more than $1 million, your employer must use the flat rate method and calculate your bonus withholdings (over $1 million) at 37 percent.\nSometimes employers pay bonuses alongside regular wages. In this situation, your employer must use the aggregate method to calculate the initial tax withholding on your bonus.\nWith the aggregate method, the tax withholding on your bonus is calculated at your regular income tax rate. The withholding rate is based on your tax bracket . Often, when taxes on wages plus bonuses are calculated together this way, your initial tax withholding is higher.\nImagine your typical monthly salary is $6,000. Your tax withholding would be based on an annual salary of $72,000 ($6,000 X 12). That income amount would put you in the 22 percent federal tax bracket (assuming you file your tax return as single or head of household).\nContinuing with this example, your employer one month pays you a bonus of $10,000. The employer gives it to you alongside your regular $6,000 salary but identifies it as a bonus. Your monthly income climbs to $16,000 for the month at hand.\nUsing the aggregate method, your employer would multiply $16,000 by 12 months. This would cause the tax withholding on your bonus to be calculated as if you were earning $192,000 per year, bumping you up to the 32 percent tax bracket. The employer would subtract the taxes already withheld from your last paycheck and take the remainder out of your bonus amount.\nThe IRS will expect its cut of any bonus you receive. Even if you receive your bonus in cash, gift cards, a vacation or some other benefit, you\u2019ll generally have to pay taxes.\nThe exception to this rule is if your bonus can qualify as an employee achievement award. You might be able to avoid paying federal income taxes under the following conditions:\n- The award isn\u2019t cash, a cash equivalent (such as a gift card or money order) tickets to events, vacations, stocks, bonds or other prohibited items.\n- The award is tangible personal property.\n- The total value of the award doesn\u2019t exceed $1,600.\nThe method your employer uses to calculate the federal withholding on your bonus can have a big impact on your take-home pay. Still, you won\u2019t know how much you actually owe the IRS until you file your tax return the following year.\nIf the tax withholding on your bonus turns out to be higher than necessary, you might receive a tax refund for overpayment. On the other hand, if too little money was withheld from your income throughout the year, you could wind up owing the IRS.\nYou can reduce the risk of owing the IRS money by reviewing your W-4 withholdings. The IRS Tax Withholding Estimator is a good place to start. Also, if you receive a large bonus or your financial circumstances change, it may be best to talk to a tax professional for advice.\nWant to lower the amount of taxes withheld from your bonus? Consider asking your employer to pay your bonus separately from your regular paycheck. From there, you can see if your employer will calculate your tax withholding at the 22 percent flat rate the IRS allows for supplemental wages."], "citation_links": ["https://www.bankrate.com/taxes/how-bonuses-are-taxed/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_e86648be-8eac-4279-86b6-398c0b7b5a5e"}

They are also known to hunt walrus and fishin the Russian Arctic. Polar bears are apex predators in their environment, and their diet consists mainly of seals and other marine mammals.", "references": ["Written and fact-checked by The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\nLast Updated: \u2022 Article History\nTop Questions\nWhat is a polar bear?\nWhat do polar bears eat?\nWhat are some examples of polar bear adaptations?\nAre polar bears an endangered species?\npolar bear , ( Ursus maritimus ), also called white bear , sea bear , or ice bear , great white northern bear (family Ursidae) found throughout the Arctic region. The polar bear travels long distances over vast desolate expanses, generally on drifting oceanic ice floes, searching for seals, its primary prey. The polar bear is the largest and most powerful carnivore on land, a title it shares with a subspecies of brown bear called the Kodiak bear . It has no natural predators and knows no fear of humans, making it an extremely dangerous animal .\nPolar bears are stocky, with a long neck, relatively small head, short, rounded ears, and a short tail. The male, which is much larger than the female, weighs 410 to 720 kg (900 to 1,600 pounds). It grows to about 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) tall at the shoulder and 2.2\u20132.5 metres in length. The tail is 7\u201312 cm (3\u20135 inches) long. Sunlight can pass through the thick fur, its heat being absorbed by the bear\u2019s black skin. Under the skin is a layer of insulating fat. The broad feet have hairy soles to protect and insulate as well as to facilitate movement across ice, as does the uneven skin on the soles of the feet, which helps to prevent slipping. Strong, sharp claws are also important for gaining traction, for digging through ice, and for killing prey.\nPolar bears are solitary and overwhelmingly carnivorous, feeding especially on the ringed seal but also on the bearded seal and other pinnipeds . The bear stalks seals resting on the ice, ambushes them near breathing holes, and digs young seals from snow shelters where they are born. Polar bears prefer ice that is subject to periodic fracturing by wind and sea currents, because these fractures offer seals access to both air and water. As their prey is aquatic, polar bears are excellent swimmers, and they are even known to kill beluga whales . In swimming , the polar bear uses only its front limbs, an aquatic adaptation found in no other four-legged mammal . Polar bears are opportunistic as well as predatory: they will consume dead fish and carcasses of stranded whales and eat garbage near human settlements.\nMating occurs in spring, and implantation of the fertilized ovum is delayed. Including the delay, gestation may last 195\u2013265 days, and one to four cubs, usually two, are born during the winter in a den of ice or snow. Cubs weigh less than 1 kg at birth and are not weaned until after they are two years old. Young polar bears may die of starvation or may be killed by adult males, and for this reason female polar bears are extremely defensive of their young when adult males are present. Young remain with their mothers until they reach sexual maturity. Females first reproduce at four to eight years of age and breed every two to four years thereafter. Males mature at about the same age as females but do not breed until a few years later. Adult polar bears have no natural predators, though walruses and wolves can kill them. Longevity in the wild is 25 to 30 years, but in captivity several polar bears have lived to more than 35 years old.\nHumans probably cause most polar bear deaths, by hunting and by destroying problem animals near settlements. Polar bears have been known to kill people. The bears are hunted especially by Inuit people for their hides, tendons, fat, and flesh. Although polar bear meat is consumed by indigenous people, the liver is inedible and often poisonous because of its high vitamin A content.\nAn estimated 22,000 to 31,000 polar bears were living in the wild by 2020. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified the polar bear as a vulnerable species since 2006, and the U.S. government has listed the polar bear as a threatened species since 2008, in large part because of the influence of global warming , which continues to reduce Arctic sea ice coverage. Sea ice is prime habitat for polar bears. Population models have predicted increased rates of starvation as a result of longer ice-free seasons and a decline in mating success, since sea ice fragmentation could reduce encounter rates between males and females. Ecological studies show evidence that declines in sea ice coverage have forced polar bears to spend more time foraging for berries and seabird eggs, which are lower-quality foods that require greater effort to obtain. Given the compounding threats to the species, model forecasts suggest that polar bear populations will have declined by one-third by the year 2050.\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content."], "citation_links": ["https://www.britannica.com/animal/polar-bear"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_c6bd39dd-660c-4c76-bd4e-ae644b36f57a"}

He lived near Alf Wight\u2019s veterinary practice and his mum took him along one day and they opened the door for signings and my uncle had his book signed. So when I told him he nearly hit the roof and that was only about the audition. He was beside himself when I got the role!\u201d\nBefore All Creatures Great and Small : Playing James Herriot may be Ralph\u2019s first on-screen role, but he\u2019s not new to the acting craft. The Scottish star (and former accomplished football player!) appeared in a number of stage productions prior to his breakout role, including a number of plays with the Royal Conservatoire and the Royal Shakespeare Company in Scotland, as well as an appearance on the BBC Radio Scotland production Kidnapped . Up next for Ralph: a role in the film The Devil\u2019s Light, due to premiere in 2021.\nSamuel West\nHis Role: Samuel West plays Siegfried Farnon, the gruff, tough-love veterinarian of the town who takes a (rare) chance on newly minted veterinarian Herriot. Past his tough exterior, of course, is a man with a big heart, but Siegfried often finds animals easier to handle than people.\nPlaying the Part: To prepare for the role of dedicated veterinarian Siegfried Farnon, West wanted some real-life experience. \u201cAndy Barrett, our vet advisor, introduced me to somebody who bred horses who said \u2018this is how you check their teeth\u2019 and he opened the horse\u2019s mouth and grabbed his tongue which is pretty messy, and moved it out of the way to look at the teeth and asked me to hold on to the tongue. It takes absolute confidence and I thought, \u2018okay I am not ready to do that yet but maybe for [season] two.\u2019\nChecking horses\u2019 teeth may be new to West, but the actor does have personal experience loving animals \u2014 he\u2019s been an avid bird watcher for nearly 15 years now. \u201cI get itchy if I don\u2019t go birding for a while,\u201d he told Country Living . \u201cIt stops me thinking so much about myself\u2026 It\u2019s so easy to be squashed by human concerns.\u201d\nFor the Fans: There is something for everyone in this adaptation, according to West. \u201cThe original books and series show their age in terms of the agency and the prominence of the female characters,\u201d West said. \u201cSo, we have changed that and it is right and proper. I think it is about people who aren\u2019t very rich, which is important. \u2026This is about a very hard, quite remote community which is a collective and which has to work like one. It is suspicious about outsiders but when they prove themselves it welcomes them into the collective very strongly and I think that is extremely important now.\u201d\nWhere You\u2019ve Seen Him Before: The London-born actor is best known for his previous roles in the 1992 film Howard\u2019s End (as Leonard Bast), Notting Hill, Darkest Hour, and for television roles in such series as Netflix\u2019s The Crown , Grantchester (Season 4) and Mr. Selfridge as Frank Edwards. West also appeared on the PBS series NOVA in a dramatization about young Albert Einstein.\nWest\u2019s work doesn\u2019t end with on-screen roles. The actor has made a name for himself on stage and on radio, and has directed numerous plays since 2002. West has won a number of awards for such productions, including a London Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Award for Best Shakespearean Performance in Hamlet , and has been nominated for a number of Laurence Olivier Awards for his directing.\nAnna Madeley\nHer Role: Anna Madeley plays Mrs. Hall, the backbone of Skeldale House who keeps James and the Farnon boys in line.\nPlaying the Part: Madeley was especially interested in playing the role when learning that Mrs. Hall\u2019s story in this adaptation would be even further fleshed out. \u201cIn the books you meet her and I think she\u2019s described as \u2018A figure of grim benevolence\u2019 as she opens the door, but then she disappears off into the back of the house and you don\u2019t really get to know her,\u201d Madeley explained. \u201cIn this adaptation she really is fundamental to the running of the practice. She\u2019s integral to James\u2019 arrival there.\u201d\nFor the Fans: With the state of the world as it is now, Madeley recognizes the timely importance of the series more than ever. \u201cWe\u2019ve really noticed in lockdown just how kind people can be, how important your community is, and ultimately how much our quality of life is dependent on those things and I think you really see that in the community in All Creatures Great and Small ,\u201d she said.\nWhere You\u2019ve Seen Her Before: Madeley has previously appeared in films such as In Bruges , as well as television series such as Patrick Melrose, The Crown , and on MASTERPIECE in The Child in Time and Mr. Selfridge . The actress also recently starred in the television series Deadwater Fell alongside David Tennant, written by Grantchester writer Daisy Coulam.\nCallum Woodhouse\nHis Role : Callum Woodhouse stars as wayward, wild child brother Tristan Farnon, who believes in some work, all play (unlike his seriously hard working brother, Siegfried).\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu: The series is, oddly enough, not Woodhouse\u2019s first experience working on a show that centers on animals. The actor is most well-known for his four season run as Leslie Durrell on The Durrells in Corfu , a role not entirely unlike Tristan Farnon. To Woodhouse, it\u2019s no coincidence that he\u2019s worked on two animal-centric shows \u2014 he\u2019s a self-proclaimed animal lover. \u201cI absolutely love animals,\u201d he said. \u201c The Durrells was exotic, crazy animals \u2013 I got to hang out with lemurs and pelicans \u2013 whereas this show has more cows and goats and any scene where I am in the veterinary practice on my own I was always asking if the dog could be in the scene, too. Any scene you see me with George, our Golden Retriever (who plays Jess), that is me asking to have him in the scene with me because I love him so much.\u201d\nWhere You\u2019ve Seen Him Before : In addition to his successful run on The Durrells in Corfu , alongside stars like Keeley Hawes and Josh O\u2019Connor, Woodhouse has appeared in a number of films and series such as Cold Feet , B&B , and Father Brown . Woodhouse, however, is mostly ready for a new title \u2014 as a fashion icon for his All Creatures Great and Small role. \u201cWhen I was doing some research before the show,\u201d he told RadioTimes . \u201cI found a Pinterest board called \u2018Tristan Knitwear\u2019: endless images of every jumper, every Fair Isle sweater, that Peter Davison [who played him in the original BBC series] wore! Oh my God, is it going to be that big this time round? That\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\nRachel Shenton\nHer Role : Actress Rachel Shenton plays Helen Alderson, a local farmer that catches the eye of James Herriot. She\u2019s a hardworking woman who takes on much of the farm\u2019s responsibilities, and that of raising her younger sister, Jenny.\nPlaying Helen : Shenton admires her character greatly, for Helen\u2019s wit, her loyalty, her drive, and the way \u201cshe doesn\u2019t sit around waiting for something to happen, she just goes out and does it,\u201d Shenton said. But it was Shenton\u2019s research into the real-life Helen that really struck her. \u201cWhat I love about her the most is what I learned from meeting the real-life Helen\u2019s (Joan Danbury Wight) children, Rosie and Jim; that she is mischievous and fun loving in spite of having been through some really tough times,\u201d she explained.\nThat, and Helen\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cI will gladly state that Helen has the best wardrobe, bar none,\u201d she said. \u201cShe has serious style for a farmer\u2019s daughter.\u201d\nWhere You\u2019ve Seen Her Before: Prior to All Creatures Great and Small , Shenton was best known for her roles on television series such as the ABC Family series Switched at Birth, White Gold and the long-running British soap opera Hollyoaks. Shenton has also won a number of awards \u2014 most notably, an Academy Award in 2017 for Best Live Action Short Film, The Silent Child , which Shenton wrote and starred in.\nMatthew Lewis\nHis Role : Harry Potter star Matthew Lewis (hello, Neville Longbottom!) plays Hugh Hulton, a local, wealthy horse racer and landowner who has his own involvement with farmer Helen Alderson.\nGetting the Job: Before he even got the part, there was someone who thought Harry Potter star Matthew Lewis was a perfect fit. \u201cCoincidentally, when I received the script for All Creatures Great and Small the make-up artist on the film I was working on in New Zealand talked to me about the series because my accent reminded her of it,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs well as being an institution in the UK, it was hugely popular in the Commonwealth. So I was very much aware of its popularity, and I do recall when it was announced that they were doing a new series of it, my dad said \u2018Oh, you should try and get involved in that!\u2019 Little did I know just how charming, funny and endearing James Herriot\u2019s world really is.\u201d\nPlaying the Part: Jumping into a period drama has a certain magic of its own, thanks to the costumes, the hair, the make-up and all. It was an experience Lewis thoroughly enjoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun as it\u2019s so different, and it\u2019s kind of the reason why I got into acting in the first place, I was always daydreaming and imagining being in other places and doing other things. When you do a period piece, that\u2019s exactly it, you\u2019re transported to another place which is a real luxury for an actor.\u201d\nAnd is Lewis himself an animal fan? \u201cI am a huge animal lover! I grew up with two rabbits. Unfortunately, when I left my parents, I was in no position to own another animal. I was desperate to, but I was constantly working away from home and lived on my own and it was very difficult. Now that I\u2019m married, when I\u2019m away, my wife is still at home. We have two dogs and we actually live at the back of a nature reserve, so we\u2019ve got turtles, otters, ducks, I reckon there\u2019s an alligator back there as well, actually.\u201d\nWhere You\u2019ve Seen Him Before: Aside from his best known role as Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter films, Lewis has also appeared in films and series such as Me Before You , Happy Valley , and Ripper Street . Don\u2019t be surprised if you see Lewis in his Neville Longbottom costume, even after all these years. The star admitted to BuzzFeed in one interview that he\u2019d taken some costumes with him after filming was done! \u201cI\u2019ve got the whole Neville outfit from the final [ Harry Potter ] film. The trousers and the shirt and the cardigan, sort of covered in blood and burn marks and stuff. They know I\u2019ve got it now, but I did steal it \u2013 with the help of a costume dresser. We worked together and we smuggled it out of the building.\u201d\nDiana Rigg\nHer Role: In one of her last roles, the late Diana Rigg stars as the eccentric, affable Mrs. Pumphrey, a frequent client of Siegfried\u2019s thanks to her spoiled canine, Tricki Woo. Mrs. Pumphrey can afford a life of luxury and comfort, and that goes just as well for Tricki Woo, who enjoys a few too many savory pleasures in life. James, Tristan, and Siegfried do their best to help.\nWhere You\u2019ve Seen Her Before: Rigg was a beloved presence on MASTERPIECE for decades. The former MASTERPIECE Mystery! host has appeared in a number of series over the years, including (but not limited to) her role as the Duchess of Buccleuch on Victoria ; her Primetime Emmy award-winning role as Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca ; Lady Honoria Dedlock in Bleak House , and more. The acclaimed, award-winning actress was also known for her roles on Game of Thrones, The Avengers and even for her stage work \u2014 in 1994, she won a Tony Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play for her role in Medea ."], "citation_links": ["https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/specialfeatures/meet-the-cast-of-all-creatures-great-and-small/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_145d9385-f809-4ac7-b491-d995563a55a7"}

If there is an extra chip left over after the pot has been split, then the first player seated clockwise from the dealer gets it. In heads-up, the player who was the Big Blind gets the extra chip.", "references": ["From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nIn poker it is sometimes necessary to split , or divide the pot among two or more players rather than awarding it all to a single player. This can happen because of ties, and also by playing intentional split-pot poker variants (the most typical of these is high-low split poker , where the high hand and low hand split the pot).\nTo split a pot, one player uses both hands to take the chips from the pot and make stacks, placing them side by side to compare height (and therefore value). Equal stacks are placed aside. If there is more than one denomination of chip in the pot, the largest value chip is done first, and then progressively smaller value chips. If there is an odd number of larger chips, smaller chips from the pot can be used to equalize stacks or make change as necessary. Pots are always split down to the lowest denomination of chip used in the game. Three-way ties or further splits can also be done this way.\nAfter fully dividing a pot, there may be a single odd lowest-denomination chip remaining (or two odd chips if splitting three ways, etc.). Odd chips can be awarded in several ways, agreed upon before the beginning of the game. The following rules are common:\n- If playing a high-low split game and dividing a pot between the high and low hands, always award the odd chip to the high hand.\n- If splitting a pot because of tied hands, award the odd chip to the hand that contains the highest-ranking single card, using suits to break ties if necessary (clubs ranking the lowest, followed by diamonds, hearts, and spades as in bridge ).\n- (Variation) Between tied hands, award the odd chip to the first player in clockwise rotation from the dealer. (Note that in a casino stud game with a house dealer and no button this gives an unfair advantage to players on the dealer's left, so the high card by suit method is preferred).\n- (Variation) Leave the odd chip as an extra ante for the next deal. This is common in home games.\nSometimes it is necessary to further split a half pot into quarters, or even smaller portions. This is especially common in community card high-low split games such as Omaha hold'em , where one player has the high hand and two or more players have tied low hands. Unfortunate players receiving such a fractional pot call it being quartered . When this happens, an exception to the odd chip rules above can be made: if the high hand wins its half of the pot alone, and the low half is going to be quartered, the odd chip (if any) from the first split should be placed in the low half, rather than being awarded to the high hand."], "citation_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_%28poker%29"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_0df54dc9-20e8-47eb-b849-a4a2f1f7c672"}

BMI, or weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, is often used to measure overweight and obesity.\nHere are the ranges of BMI:\n\u00b7 18.5 to 24.9: normal weight\n\u00b7 25 to 29.9: overweight\n\u00b7 30+: obesity\nBased on BMI, more than 70% of US adults are considered overweight or obese. The average BMI in the US is 26.6 for adult men and 26.5 for adult women.\nStarting in the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in the percent of adults who are overweight or obese. The percent of men with obesity jumped from 13 to 21 percent between 1980 and 1991, while the percent of women with obesity jumped from 17 to 26 percent. This trend has continued for 30 years into the current decade.\nBeing overweight or obese is a risk factor for certain health issues. Compared to those with a normal weight, people who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk of developing the following conditions:\n\u00b7 High blood pressure\n\u00b7 Type 2 diabetes\n\u00b7 Heart disease\n\u00b7 Stroke\n\u00b7 Liver disease\n\u00b7 Sleep apnea\n\u00b7 Certain types of cancer, including endometrial, liver, kidney, pancreatic, and colon cancer\n\u00b7 Arthritis and joint pain\n\u00b7 Depression and anxiety\nThere may be a variety of mechanisms through which excess fat contributes to disease development. For example, fat cells secrete substances that contribute to chronic inflammation, a state that is associated with certain diseases. Having too much fat may also impact insulin resistance, blood lipid levels, blood pressure, reproduction, and other bodily processes.\nConsidering that the majority of American adults are overweight or obese, and that excess weight is linked to many health problems, maintaining a healthy weight is incredibly important.\nWhile some people believe that you need to lose all of your excess weight to reap benefits, research suggests otherwise. Losing just 5% of total body weight can be very beneficial for those who are overweight or obese and can help prevent associated health problems.\nMaking diet and lifestyle changes, like implementing meal prep or signing up for a healthy meal delivery service, can be helpful for losing weight.

Is my child ok? What happens next?\u201d Fighting in school is something that occurs fairly frequently, and it can have serious consequences. Here, I will discuss some of the consequences that your child might face and how to proceed.\nAfter learning that your child was involved in a fight on school property, you need to get the facts. You might be asked to go to the school and discuss what happened with your child, the other child involved in the fight, and their parents. You should get the full facts of what happened, including:\n- Who instigated the fight.\n- Who started the physical altercation.\n- How many people were involved in the fight and who they are.\n- The extent of the injuries sustained.\n- If your child or the other child involved in the fight have a history of fighting \u2013 either with each other or with other students.\n- What the school\u2019s policy on fighting is.\n- If the police were contacted or will be contacted.\n- What happens next.\nOnce you have all of the information regarding what happened, you can figure out how to proceed.\nThe consequences for fighting on school property should be outlined in your child\u2019s Student Handbook. Refer to this handbook to determine what happens next.\nMost schools have policies that state that fighting results in a suspension. Some schools require an out-of-school suspension, while others accept an in-school suspension. Many schools will also take other factors into consideration before determining a suspension.\nFighting in school could be very serious for your child. In some cases, they could get expelled. You should communicate with the school about your child\u2019s penalty.\nMany schools allow a student a hearing in which they can plead their case for a lesser penalty. The school will take into consideration the severity of the fight as well as their past behavior and school performance. Leniency might be granted a student who has no prior issues with the school , who performs well, and who contributes to the school community. Such factors can be presented during the student hearing.\nSometimes, fights on school property are handled internally, with the school. Other times, the police are involved.\nWhen a juvenile commits a crime , there are many different punishment options open to him or her. In many cases, a juvenile may receive a fine, a period of probation, community service hours, etc. instead of a jail sentence. This is because penalties for juvenile crimes are meant to rehabilitate the child as opposed to punishing him or her. One such rehabilitative option that may be open to your child is the school violence education program.\nThe school violence education program is a pretrial diversionary program for juveniles. If a child threatens the use of physical violence or uses physical violence at a public school, a private school, or a school-sponsored event, he or she will become eligible for this program.\nTo be admitted, a child must make a motion to apply for this program. The court may order a suspension of delinquency proceedings for one year and order the child to participate in this program if the court determines that the child needs and will likely benefit from the program and if the suspension of proceedings will advance the interests of justice.\nA child is eligible for the school violence education program if he or she agrees to participate in an anger management program and nonviolent conflict resolution of at least eight group sessions. The child must complete this program before being eligible for the school violence education program.\nIn addition, the child must agree to comply with court orders. Finally, the child\u2019s parents or guardians should certify under penalty of a false statement that to their knowledge, their child does not possess any firearms, dangerous weapons, controlled substances , or other materials prohibited by law.\nIf the court denies the motion to allow the child into the school violence education program, the delinquency proceedings will continue against the child.\nIf the police get involved in your child\u2019s school fight, your child could face criminal charges. You can try to minimize this situation by contacting a juvenile defense attorney as soon as possible.\nDealing with the police on top of the school issues can be overwhelming. The right lawyer can take the burden off of your family and handle the legal issues involved."], "citation_links": ["https://www.ruaneattorneys.com/connecticut-criminal/juvenile-defense/juveniles-and-school-issues/school-fighting/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_442b9247-9a4d-4d02-8ece-2316e072a41a"}

For example, bonuses can be deferred until a later year when the athlete's tax rate is lower, or they can be paid out in forms that are taxed at a lower rate, such as stock options or retirement accounts. Ultimately, the decision to convert salary to bonuses depends on each athlete's individual financial situation and goals.", "references": ["Young athletes who are drafted onto a pro team are suddenly wealthy at a very young age. It's a rare 20-something who's prepared for that. They often lack the financial knowledge to manage the large sums of money they're earning, Sports Illustrated noted.\n1\nAnd they're mostly focused on getting on the field and scoring points. Contrast that with someone who builds a career or their own business over decades. They have time to learn about managing that money and often a network of long-standing, trusted, and knowledgeable connections to help them.\nTyson and Iverson are among many athletes who didn't plan ahead and budget for the funds they would need later in life but instead lived a lifestyle based on their peak earnings. Iverson is now waiting to cash in on a $32 million rainy-day trust fund sponsored by Reebok as part of a previous deal he made with the brand. But he can't access the trust fund until 2030.\nComprehensive money-management training programs for players could offer them information that goes beyond simple recommendations for investments or rookie camp workshops, according to Lusardi and Camerer.\n5\nTheir suggestions for players\u2014figuring out how far into the future their money can last and how to build a budget that allows them to achieve their objectives\u2014are good advice for anyone, though.\nRegardless of your net worth , you have to play an active role in the management of your financial affairs. Even the best money manager won't care about your money as much as you do and, for that reason, you have to be the final and most important decision maker. And those decisions have to be grounded in financial knowledge.\nIf you know very little about managing money, it's never too late to change that. Financial literacy and money management education can help you understand everything from the rewards of compound interest to how financial markets work and develop healthy financial habits.\nIn June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) can't limit education-related benefits\u2014such as paid internships and postgraduate scholarships\u2014for athlete recruits.\n8\nThere has been a long-standing controversy over the sizable revenue generated by college sports. The players, who actually create the income, see none at all. The NCAA maintains that not compensating athletes preserves amateurism in college sports.\n9\nMany of the athletes who find themselves broke are big spenders. They make the mistake of matching their spending level to what their peak earnings allow (or beyond). When those earnings end, the payments due on houses, cars, and a lavish lifestyle continue\u2014and the athletes fall off a financial cliff.\nGood, long-term money management is contrary to the accumulation of \"stuff.\" Billionaire Warren Buffett may be as famous for his modest lifestyle as he is for his wealth. NFL player Glover Quin drove the same SUV for years.\n6\n\"I never had a Bentley. I never had a Maserati,\" he told NBCSports. \"My wife and I lived well. We just didn\u2019t live extravagantly.\"\n10\nAthletes' spending isn't all on material luxuries, of course. It's also easy for players to become cash machines for family and friends who need support or are hopeful entrepreneurs.\n11\n\"There's a pressure that comes with being the African-American success story,\" wealth manager Humble Lukanga told The Washington Post . (Lukanga manages some $500 million for mostly Black clients in sports and entertainment.) \"You are some community's pride and joy. And that community has protected you. That community has given you free haircuts when you couldn't afford it. That community has sponsored your football teams, your basketball team.\"\n12\nEven a multimillion-dollar salary only goes so far, though. Armed with sound financial knowledge, young athletes can budget for being generous with their community without putting themselves at financial risk.\nRegardless of your income level, it's smart to live a lifestyle that doesn't stretch your budget. Not only will it set you up for financial freedom, but it's far easier to sleep at night when you're not worried about the next paycheck.\nYes, there are great examples of iconic athletes who've achieved enduring financial success . The richest athlete of all time is basketball superstar Michael Jordan, whose $2.1 billion fortune was built from his NBA income, sponsorships, and investments, including a majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets.\n13\nNBA player Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson formed Magic Johnson Enterprises years before he stopped playing and has built it into a $1 billion conglomerate.\n14\nSerena Williams won more tennis Grand Slams (23) than any other player and four Olympic gold medals. Her career prize money made her the second highest-paid woman athlete, and she's put that\u2014and income from almost 20 corporate sponsorships\u2014to good use in diverse business interests and her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures.\n15\n16\nFinancial literacy education before any contracts are signed, ongoing money management training beyond rookie camp workshops, and compensation structures that pay out over time would be helpful. The key for young pros is to manage a short spike of high income so that it can last a lifetime.\nCompared to most people, pro athletes have very short careers. And if their contract isn\u2019t renewed or they get injured, their careers can unexpectedly be cut even shorter. In addition, pro athletes tend to be intensely focused on their sport, sometimes to the exclusion of other important matters, such as their personal finances.\nTake a cue from the many athletes who have found themselves broke later in life. Spending so much today that you can't save anything or invest for a secure future is a losing proposition regardless of how much money you make. If you don't consider yourself a good money manager, ask for help.\nSponsored\nAccess to World-Class Learning From Top Universities\nAre you interested in developing skills related to banking, investment management, or other fields related to finance?

Now that\u2019s a lot of money. Some people don\u2019t believe that athletes should be paid more than regular jobs. However, I believe that they should be paid more. Anyone can go to college and get a degree as a doctor, or in nursing. But it takes a certain type of person to be an athlete good enough to win against other great athletes.\nAthletes have to work hard to keep in shape as well as continue to practice for future competitions. While in regular jobs, you go into your workplace clock in for the day, and can just mess around and do nothing and earn the same amount of money as someone who is working hard at your job.\nI would say that professional athletes should be paid more because they have to train every day at practice to become better and also show a good game. Without these athletes, we wouldn\u2019t have any entertainment. These athletes are getting paid a lot of money to get the best training so they can stay.\n\u201cI\u2019m like tax.

Before that film reexamines the impact of the renowned saxophonist, The Ringer will spend this week revisiting other cultural figures, concepts, and even sports, that are likewise in need of a reevaluation.\nA strange feature of American exceptionalism during the 1980s and \u201990s was that we wanted to import everything but culture. This is one way to understand the bizarre anxiety and contempt with which much of the American sports media regarded soccer in the late 20th century: It was the wrong kind of product. Our cars, our clothes, and our kitchen mixers could be made in other countries\u2014and they were; the U.S. trade deficit increased almost 20-fold over this span, from a shade over $19 billion in 1980 to a shade under $370 billion in 2000. But our movies? Our music? Our sports? Try to explain BTS to a cool American teen in 1994 and they\u2019d have looked at you like you\u2019d hurled a flowerpot at them. Music could come from the U.K. or Ireland, occasionally; we weren\u2019t xenophobes . Tiny, culty cliques of us might watch the odd British comedy or Swedish art film on VHS, if we could get it (mostly we couldn\u2019t). Beyond that, though? Thank you, Pierre, but no. American men in Bangladesh-made khakis could, without a whisper of cognitive dissonance, drive their German cars while listening to their Chinese-engineered radio consoles, where they\u2019d spend drivetime deriding soccer as a foreign menace, a cosmopolitan threat to American strength\u2014a \u201cgame for beret-wearers,\u201d as Ann Coulter once put it.\nThat\u2019s one way to think about the (now mostly bygone, thank goodness) American scorn for the world\u2019s most popular game. Another way is to reverse the equation. Culture, during those years, was what we wanted to export . The invisible foreigners who populated the shelves of our Kmarts with running shoes and waffle irons were supposed to love, and purchase, American cultural products. And often they did! Look at the international box office, which exploded during the late 20th century. The top film of 1980, The Empire Strikes Back , made 54 percent of its gross from the domestic market; the top film of 1997, Titanic , earned almost 70 percent of its gross from the international market. In 1997, for the first time, Hollywood earned more money outside the United States than inside it. Call it cultural imperialism if you want; the sun never set on our vibe. We were winning the Cold War, buying cheap CD players, and spreading Forrest Gump (international box office share: 51 percent) around the world.\nSpreading it, that is, except for the football scenes. Sports were the great omission from America\u2019s sphere of cultural influence. These days, with the NBA returning to state TV in China, with David Beckham running a soccer club in Miami from courtside seats in L.A., it can be hard to remember how utterly sequestered American sports used to be from the rest of the world. The astonishing popularity of soccer across much of the world meant that our sports struggled to attract attention beyond our own borders. People who could name the cast of Friends could not name a member of the Dallas Cowboys. Everyone, everywhere knew who Michael Jordan was, but in the same way that everyone in Ohio knew Pel\u00e9 in 1977: mostly not from watching his games. America set the world\u2019s agenda in music, in film, in fashion, but it did not set the agenda in big-time professional sports. Soccer was too big. It wouldn\u2019t budge for us.\nIn a real sense, then, world football was the place where America encountered the horizon of its own influence. It is unsettling, if you are the king, to see the mountain where your kingdom ends; I think that\u2019s how soccer felt to many Americans. Past this line you do not call the shots. Maybe you\u2019ve noticed that nationalism has a way of translating masculine insecurity into aggression; maybe you\u2019ve noticed that sports tends to be the venue where masculine insecurity goes to protect and reassure itself. For a certain type of American man\u2014say, the type who would very much like to get the attention of a roomful of eighth-grade boys by barking \u201cAll right, girls, listen up\u201d; the type that drove almost all sports coverage before the internet, and still drives maybe two-thirds of it\u2014it became necessary to define soccer as a contemptible other. Soccer had to be not just un-American, but un-American in ways that revealed the inherent superiority of American-ness, the untrustworthiness and effeminacy and shiftless, beret-wearing, welfare-state prissiness of the rest of the world.\nIt is almost impossible to exaggerate what a bizzaro-town reading of the sport this was at a time when soccer hooligans were sucking out each other\u2019s eyeballs, right-wing populist groups were actively recruiting at English soccer grounds, bougie middle-class Europeans wanted nothing to do with a game they saw as violent and d\u00e9class\u00e9, piss-filled balloons routinely splashed down on traveling supporters, and Roy Keane existed. For that matter, soccer had once actually been a pretty popular sport in America\u2014bigger than the NFL in the 1920s, though nowhere near as big as college football\u2014and millions of American kids were playing it every weekend. But the accuracy, historicity, and consistency of the reading mattered less than how it made Joe Colts Fan feel. It made him feel good! And thus, for many, many years, soccer in the United States became the subject of one of the most comprehensive cultural misunderstandings since the first Christian in Rome turned to the guy next to him and said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always wanted to see the inside of the Colosseum.\u201d\nDo you remember this era? It wasn\u2019t that long ago. I guess it ended around 2006, though for a long time after that, and even to this day, tendrils of anti-soccer sentiment would sometimes unfurl in the more goateed corners of the discourse. At some point, those millions of soccer-playing kids started to grow up, MLS convinced people it wasn\u2019t going away, Fever Pitch made it safe for rich people to like Arsenal, and improved communication technology made it easier to watch international games. The sport started to seem young and cool rather than alien and crypto-socialist. (Socialism also started to seem young and cool.) It became possible to support both the troops and Manchester United. The world turned, and if your boomer relatives continued to complain about Neymar, you could take it in stride, knowing that millions of hardcore soccer fans, on multiple continents, were complaining about Neymar at all times.\nThings got better. But before then? Oh my God, the nonsense we endured. I speak as a fan; also as someone who used to go to an auto-repair place that played Jim Rome in the waiting room. They were good, honest mechanics and, I believe, had simply lost the remote. Anyway, it was carnage. Every sports columnist in America used to wake up twice a year and phone in a lazy, pandering anti-soccer rant, the main takeaway of which was always \u201cI love leaving work at 2:30.\u201d Probably the most perceptive, and therefore dumbest, of these was written by the revered Sports Illustrated writer Frank Deford, in 2001 . Deford notes\u2014perceptively!\u2014that soccer\u2019s trouble in America has something to do with the reluctance of Americans to import culture. But rather than thinking through the causes of that close-mindedness, Deford celebrates it: \u201cWhat we Americans do is pass along our stuff to other, impressionable peoples.\u201d Cool sentence. Americans like scoring, he writes, and therefore:\nThe reason that we don\u2019t care about soccer is that it is un-American. It\u2019s somebody else\u2019s way of life. So most American kids abandon interest in the game when they realize it\u2019s not consistent with what they are finding out about Americanism. The same with immigrants and their children\u2014as soon as they discover more appealing games that reflect American spirit, American values. It\u2019s really very simple why most of us nonsocialistic Americans will forever reject soccer.\nPlease imagine reading a version of this every three months for 20 years; you now have an inkling of what it used to be like to be American and suspect that the most intensely beloved game on the planet might be\u2014you know\u2014good.\nIt gets worse. Here is a line that the Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy\u2014who wrote and rewrote the same anti-soccer column for 25 years\u2014published, on purpose, in 1994 , the year the U.S. hosted the World Cup:\nHow good can any game be when you can\u2019t use your hands? Hands are what separate us from the animal kingdom.\nHands. Are what separate us. From the animal kingdom. I cannot tell you how many writers made this argument during the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years. Thousands. Friends, I implore you. Here is a game that several billion people think is fun and exciting. Do not be tempted to learn about it. Respect the essential difference between yourself and a giraffe.\nHere\u2019s the sportswriter Allen Barra in 2002 :\nTo [soccer nerds], soccer is \u201cdemocratic\u201d because it eliminates the swiftest and the most powerful and takes for its physical standard the average European male. In other words, the average soccer nerd\u2019s own height and weight.\nThis is correct. I enjoy soccer because it takes for its physical standard the average European male. There were various physical standards it could have taken\u2014swifter, more powerful ones\u2014but it took a 5-foot-9 Latvian beachgoer named Ivo. I met him once at FIFA headquarters. He was a little cold in his Speedo, but we had a nice chat about how we\u2019re exactly the same height and weight.\nAnyway, Allen Barra likes soccer now .\nHere\u2019s the pundit Jim Rome, in 17,000 BC :\nMy son is not playing soccer. I will hand him ice skates and a shimmering sequined blouse before I hand him a soccer ball.\nHere\u2019s Hank Hill:\nSome of these rants, to be fair to their writers, belong to a tradition of semi-shtick, what my colleague Bryan Curtis, in a 2018 column about the disappearance of the American soccer troll , called \u201ccomic nativism.\u201d Some of them do not belong to any comic tradition, at least not on purpose, and are meant to be taken seriously. It\u2019s easy to tell the difference; the serious ones are much funnier. In any case, this steady drip of transferred angst about American manhood and American national prestige and (uh) American hand-having defined the popular conception of the sport for years. A big part of the national sports media looked at soccer fans like: Oh, here\u2019s a thing you enjoy; I am going to yell \u201cfreedom fries\u201d at the top of my lungs while you watch it.\nSoccer still isn\u2019t massively popular in America. What\u2019s changed is something subtler: It now seems more embarrassing to say this stuff than to be attacked by the people who say it. I mean, most little boys would probably love a pair of ice skates and a sequined blouse? I\u2019m sure that fact still makes a lot of dads nervous, but more and more people can see that it\u2019s not their sons they\u2019re nervous for. The idea of a game embodying or undermining fundamental American values seems faintly ridiculous in the era of Shohei Ohtani in California and Christian Pulisic at Stamford Bridge. And in an era when the 2020 Best Picture winner and half the biggest shows on Netflix come from abroad, loudly refusing to engage with the world is no longer quite the rhetorical slam dunk it once was.\nI still sometimes think that soccer in America could use a cultural reassessment. Have we totally figured out our approach to fandom\u2014one that\u2019s not copy-pasting from the Premier League or the NFL? Have we figured out how to balance our interest in building the domestic game with our interest in watching the best players and teams in the world, or worked out how both those interests relate to the future of our national teams? Not completely, I think. Still, it\u2019s infinitely better than it used to be.

The education you receive there, and the attitudes you develop, will guide you for the rest of your life. Your grades will be especially important in landing your first job, or when applying to graduate school. To be a successful student requires certain skills; but, these are skills that can be learned .\nThe Basics of Being a Good Student\n- Prioritize your life: Doing well in school should be your top priority.\n- Study: There is no substitute.\n- Always attend class.\n- Do all of the homework and assigned reading.\n- Develop self-discipline.\n- Manage your time.\nSelf-Discipline Made Easy\nHuman beings are creatures of habit. Therefore, form a habit of doing what you reason you should do. Is it not foolish for your behavior to contradict your own reasoning? And what could be more harmonious than finding yourself wanting to do what you know you should?\nTrain yourself so there is an immediate reaction-mechanism within you:\nYou reason that you should do something, and thus you do it.\nOther people who seem to have less difficulty with self-discipline probably have simply had more practice at it, thereby making it less difficult; because, practice is what it takes.\nTime Management\nNo matter how you slice it, there are only 24 hours in a day. Good time-management requires:\n- Note taking on more than you can handle.\n- Reasonably estimating the time required to perform each of the tasks at hand.\n- Actually doing what needs to be done.\nOnly you can do these things. A couple of thoughts, though, that may help spur you on:\n- A minute now is as precious as a minute later. You can't put time back on the clock.\n- If you're not ahead of schedule, then you're behind schedule. Because, if you try to remain right on schedule, then any mishap or misjudgment will cause you to fall behind---perhaps right at the deadline, when no recovery is possible.\nIntrospection\n- Understand, and be honest with, yourself. All else follows from this.\n- Be both athlete and coach: Keep one eye on what you are doing, and one eye on yourself.\n- Take command of, and responsibility for, yourself.\n- Face your insecurities head-on. Some common signs of insecurity: Asking a question to which you already know the answer; being artificially social with instructors or other students, when the real reason is to temporarily kill the pain.\n- Form a positive self-image: Those students who are first entering college will probably have doubts about how well they will do. Try to do well immediately to instill an expectation of continuing to do well. Settle for nothing less. Nevertheless, try not be restricted by your past performance and experiences, good or bad. Learn from the past, but don't be bound by it. Seek out your weaknesses and attack them. Be realistic about your limitations; but, don't let this lead to becoming satisfied with them.\nTaking a Course\nEach student's attitude is some mixture of the following:\n- He/She wants to learn the material.\n- He/She wants to get a good grade.\n- He/She doesn't care.\nEach instructor's attitude is some mixture of the following:\n- He/She wants students to learn the material.\n- He/She wants grading to be fair and reflect students' knowledge and abilities.\n- He/She doesn't care.\nIn order to do well in a course, it is up to you (the student) to do two things:\n- Learn the material.\n- Learn the instructor.\nAs for the latter, pay attention in class to the instructor's patterns, to what he/she emphasizes, etc. Gather information about the instructor from other students. A good instructor, however, will present their course in such a way that it will be of little benefit for the student to try to learn him/her, thereby forcing their students to learn the material.\nHomework\n- Keep in mind that your work is being graded by a human being . Thus:\n- Write legibly, orderly, and coherently.\n- Supply any commentary necessary to make it clear what you are attempting to do.\nMaking the grader's job easier will more likely lead to you getting the benefit of doubt when it occurs.\n- Don't think that getting the right answer to a homework problem implies that you have mastered the corresponding material. All you have done is solve one particular problem; that does not mean you have necessarily learned how to solve all such problems (such as the ones to appear on your exams). It's up to you to view the homework problems from this wider perspective.\n- If available, always go over the solutions provided by the instructor, even if you did well on the assignment. He/She may demonstrate methods (perhaps more efficient) or provide useful information that you hadn't thought of.\nExams\n- Preparation:\n- Roughly prioritize material as to its importance (primary, secondary, tertiary), and concentrate your studying on the most significant topics. Remember, the instructor only has a limited amount of time to test what you know and can do. Thus, keep in mind when preparing for an exam that the problems cannot be too complicated if they are to fit within the allotted time.\n- Study in ways that are suited to you.\n- Study with a group or alone based upon which is really best for you.\n- Do your most strenuous and important work during those times of the day that you work best.\n- Summarize or outline the course or text material in your own words. Writing a summary not only forces you to examine the subject matter in detail, but provides a compendium to review just prior to the exam.\n- Play it safe: Memorize somewhat more than what the instructor says is required. Bring a calculator even if it's not suggested. Etc.\n- Study old exams if the instructor is known to give similar exams. But, don't be fooled into thinking that since you were able to work through an old exam, it means you understand all the course material in general, and can perform in a test situation.\n- Bring your own paper and a watch.\n- Fighting exam anxiety: Convince yourself that all you can do is all you can do; but, don't let that lead you to become complacent. Just be determined to be \"on\" for the duration of the exam. (Give yourself a pep-talk to this effect prior to each exam.)\n- Starting the exam:\n- Read the instructions thoroughly and carefully.\n- Skim over the entire exam prior to beginning work.\n- Don't necessarily do the problems in order. Instead, get those problems out of the way you feel confident you can do quickly and well. Observe how the problems are weighted, and direct your efforts to where you believe you can pick up points most easily. This does not necessarily mean attempting the most heavily weighted problem first; rather, it means first doing the problem for which you can accumulate points at the fastest rate . Indeed, there is a good chance that this is not the most heavily weighted problem, since many instructors dislike giving any one problem significantly greater or fewer points than the average, thereby underweighting the harder problems and overweighting the easier ones.\n- Before writing on any given problem, think . A small investment in time at the beginning can save time overall (for you might thereby choose a more efficient method of solving the problem).\n- Do precisely what is requested. In particular, don't waste time doing things that will not receive credit. For example, unless explicitly required, do not rewrite the exam problems on your paper.\n- Pace yourself through the exam. Example: On a 50-minute exam worth a 100 points, you should be accumulating 2 points per minute; thus, a 26-point problem should be completed in 13 minutes. Do this calculation at the start of the exam if the problem weights are given.\n- If only for psychological reasons, most graders use nonlinear grading by which the early points of a problem are easier to get:\nTherefore, always write something (meaningful) down for every problem, if only a little. At the other end, even with linear grading, there are diminishing returns in terms of points-per-effort in trying to squeeze every last point out of a given problem; if time is low, it may be better to move on.\n- Communicate with the grader. In particular, if you are running out of time, state the steps you would perform if you were to continue the problem.\n- Show your work and make clear your reasoning in order to have a chance to receive partial credit.\n- As with homework, and even more importantly, neatness counts.\n- In courses on subjective material (e.g., humanities), just regurgitate the material from class and the text(s). Supplying you own opinions may sound good in theory, but it has the risk of running counter to the opinions of the instructor or grader. Conversely, restatements of the class/text material are easy for the grader to recognize as something deserving credit. Remember: Unless the exam is multiple-choice, then a human being---who typically wants to grade the many exams in front of him/her as quickly and painlessly as possible---is doing the grading.\n- Always check over your answers if you have time.\nFurther Suggestions\n- Unify and simplify your knowledge: A textbook presents the subject in a particular form, as does an instructor. By their very natures, however, textbooks and lectures tend to present subjects sequentially. Take the extra step of understanding the material in your terms, which may involve recognizing relationships that could not be conveniently expressed in the order presented in the text(s) and lectures.\n- Remember, almost every logically consistent topic is simple at its foundation. Try to recognize the simple underlying relationships in the subject at hand; these are often left unstated by instructors and textbooks.\n- Try to learn general principles and methods. Learning by examples (putting the new in terms of the familiar) can only take you so far.\n- Learn as many methods of problem-solving as you can. This is especially helpful for exams, when time is of the essence.\n- Ask yourself questions. Why didn't the instructor or text(s) do this or that? Explore your own ideas. Try to understand the course material in detail .\n- It is often said that the best way to learn something is to teach it. Do you know the subject matter well enough to explain it clearly and completely to someone else?\n- Learn by observing others. Notice what works for them and consider incorporating those methods into yourself. Ask yourself \"Why didn't I think of that?\", and try to develop the related ability.\n- Attempt to be methodical, neat, legible, deliberate, precise, knowledgeable, and reliable on the one hand, and creative, spontaneous, imaginative, smart, clever, articulate, and flexible on the other. The first mentality thrives on order, and inherently tries to do well what it already knows how to do; the second mentality thrives on disorder, and inherently tries to expand upon its abilities. Adopt the best of these two mentalities. Remember, every tool is a potential crutch. The first mentality may rely too heavily on already-mastered skills; but, the second mentality may fail to carefully apply those same skills.\n- Think about and question everything, even the statements appearing here ( and , yourself!). But, realize that it is equally foolish to be different merely for the sake of being different, as it is to mindlessly conform to the norm.\n- For maximum efficiency, have several projects going at once. Then, if you get tired, frustrated, or bored working on one item, you can easily move onto something else, thereby staying productive as well as giving pending problems a chance to work themselves out subconsciously.\n- Anticipate. For example, you may need to ask the instructor about the present assignment, but he/she is only guaranteed to be available at certain times; therefore, you should look over the assignment early.\n- Forget pulling \"all-nighters\". These merely amount to borrowing from tomorrow, at which time you will find yourself considerably less functional. All-nighters are really an indication of not having properly planned your activities.\n- If possible, bring your textbook(s) to class.\n- Take your lecture notes in pencil, since any modifications can then be made quickly and neatly.\nClosing\nOverall, there is one basic trait that distinguishes successful students from those that are not:\nSuccessful students force themselves to understand.\nThey do not merely go through the motions of attending class, reading the text(s), and doing the homework, expecting these actions to necessarily suffice. Rather, they are continually asking, \"Do I really understand what's going on here?\" They ask this question of themselves honestly, applying an internal barometer formed from experience to detect the slightest lack of understanding, be it ignorance or confusion. And, if the answer is \"No\", then the situation is viewed as unacceptable, and more effort is the response.\nHow to Be a Good Student \u00a91997 Jerome R. Breitenbach.

Keep in mind that in Texas Hold\u2019Em, every player may play the board, meaning that the five community cards make everyone\u2019s best hand; in this case, every player would take an equal portion of the pot.\n- In high-low games, when some players win the high and others win the low\n- In games like Chicago, when certain cards (in this case, the highest spade in the hole) entitle players to half the pot\nOn the surface, splitting pots is easy enough: take the pot, split it evenly, and each player takes their winnings.\nThis is especially easy when two players have the same five-card hand: each takes half. If it\u2019s three or four or more players, all with the same hand, divide the pot by the number of players, and each player collects their winnings.\nHowever, things can get tricky fast.\nIn high-low poker variants, the players with the highest and lowest hands each win half of the pot. The easiest split pot in high-low games is when one player wins the high pot, and the other wins the low pot, as the total pot is simply split in half. If a single player has both the high and low hands, they win the entire pot.\nIn games like Omaha High-Low, where it is common for several players to have identical winning low or high hands, the pot needs to be split along more complicated lines. This is because a different number of winners may be declared for the high and low pots. In all cases, the total pot is divided evenly in half, with all high pot winners taking an equal share of their half and all low pot winners taking their equal share. For example, three players have the identical winning high hand, while only one (other) player has the winning low hand. In this case, the players with the high hands each win one-sixth of the pot, and the player with the winning low hand wins half of the pot.\nThe easiest way to manage split pots in high-low games is to first split it in two: one high pot and one low pot. Then, the players who share the winning high hand evenly divide the high pot, and the players with identical winning low hands evenly divide the low pot.\nThe most common instance of high-low split pots is quartering: two players have the same low hand, but one has a better high hand. So they split the low, and one player takes the high, so one player gets 75% of the whole pot and the other gets 25%, a quarter. But it\u2019s not uncommon for three or more players to play for the same high or low, so players might get one-sixth or one-eighth or an even smaller fraction of the pot, while one player ends up taking two-thirds of five-eighths for themselves.\nWhen one player is all in, they can win the main pot: the pot that every active player can theoretically win. But other players can continue betting amongst each other by placing their chips into a side pot: a pot that only some active players can win. Sometimes the side pots can get even bigger than the main one!\nOn the surface, side pots are relatively simple: the main pot usually gets stacked near the player who is all in, and the other two players can bet into the side pot. But, when multiple players are all-in, there might be more than one side pot: for instance, a player is blinded all in, another player goes all-in on the flop, and other players continue betting through the river and turn.\nImagine what can happen if there are three or four or more players all in at the same time, with side pots stacked all around the table, while two big stacks keep betting into one another, complicated enough at a Texas Hold\u2019Em table, and even more so at a High-Low game, where all those pots could get split up even more!\nIn these cases, the key is remembering who can win each pot. At casinos, this is simple enough, since the dealer sorts out each pot. But at home games, it\u2019s crucial to remember who can win each pot: every player can win the main pot, including the player who went all in first; then the next side pot can be won by everyone who could match the next all-in bet; and so on. If it sounds complicated, don\u2019t be afraid to take extra steps to sort it out. Make sure to separate the side pots into their own piles of chips. If you play a lot of Omaha High-Low, you might consider keeping a pad and paper at the table!\nInevitably, there will be a pot that can\u2019t be split evenly: a 5-cent chip that can\u2019t be broken down, or an even number of players will try to split a pot with an odd number of chips in it.\nIn these cases, it\u2019s always useful to be able to make change: break down one of the chips into smaller denominations so that the chips can be divvied out as evenly as possible. At casinos, the dealer will handle this. At home games, players can work it out with one another by making change with one another or with the bank.\nBut what to do with an extra chip that can\u2019t be divided evenly? Different games have different rules . Some leave it in the pot for the next hand, some give it to the player closest to the big blind. Others pick a high card, others let the dealer take it. Always know the rules of the home game you\u2019re playing in."], "citation_links": ["https://www.rookieroad.com/poker/how-do-you-split-the-pot-in-a-poker-game/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_579ab992-342e-4b0d-9466-64533811936b"}

The most familiar colour variant is the \"British Blue\", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.\nIt is one of the most ancient cat breeds known. In modern times, it remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). A quarter of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK. [1]\nThe breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland . The Cat Fanciers' Association profile reads: \"When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'.\" [2]\nThe origins of the British Shorthair most likely date back to the first century AD, making it one of the most ancient identifiable cat breeds in the world. [3] These cats were imported by the Romans who kept them to keep the camps clear of snakes, mice and insects.\nThese cats then interbred with the local European wildcat population. Over the centuries, their naturally isolated descendants developed into distinctively large, robust cats with a short but very thick coat, to better withstand conditions on their native islands. Based on artists' representations, the modern British Shorthair is unchanged from this initial type. [4]\nSelective breeding of the best examples of the type began in the nineteenth century, with emphasis on developing the unusual blue-grey variant called the \"British Blue\" or \"English type\" (to distinguish it from the more fine-boned \" Russian type \"). Some sources directly credit UK artist, and pioneering cat fancier, Harrison Weir with the initial concept of standardising the breed. Others suggest a group of breeders may have been involved. The new British Shorthair was featured at the first-ever cat show, organised by Weir and held at the Crystal Palace in London in 1871, and enjoyed great initial popularity. [5]\nBy the 1900s with the advent of the newly imported Persian and other long-haired breeds, the British Shorthair had fallen out of favour, and breeding stock had become critically rare by World War I . [6] At least partially to alleviate this, British Shorthair breeders mixed Persians into their bloodlines. [7] The genes thus introduced would eventually become the basis for the British Longhair . At the time, any long-haired cats produced were placed into the Persian breeding program. [8] As all cats with the blue colouration were then judged together as variants on a de facto single breed. The Blue Shorthair, outcrossings of the British with the Russian Blue were also common. [4]\nAfter the war, in an attempt to maintain the breed standard, the GCCF decided to accept only third-generation Persian/British Shorthair crosses. [ citation needed ] This contributed to another shortage of pure breeding stock by World War II, at which point the Persian and Russian Blue were reintroduced into the mix. [ citation needed ] British Shorthair breeders also worked with the French Chartreux , another ancient breed, which although genetically unrelated to the British Blue, is a very similar cat in appearance. Breeders worked to re-establish the true British type, and by the late 1970s, the distinctive British Shorthair had achieved formal recognition from both the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA). [4] According to the GCCF's 2013 registry data, it is once again the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country. [9]\nThe British Shorthair is a relatively powerful-looking large cat, having a broad chest, strong thick-set legs with rounded paws and a medium-length, blunt-tipped tail. The head is relatively large and rounded, with a short muzzle, broad cheeks (most noticeable in mature males, who tend to develop prominent jowls) and large round eyes that are deep coppery orange in the British Blue and otherwise vary in colour depending on the coat. Their large ears are broad and widely set. [10]\nThe British Blue variant can often be confused with the grey Scottish Fold , a breed closely related to the British Shorthair. However, the Shorthair can be characterised by having its pointy triangle ears, whereas the Fold has softer, folded ears.\nThey are slow to mature in comparison with most cat breeds, reaching full physical development at approximately three years of age. Unusually among domestic cats they are a noticeably sexually dimorphic breed, with males averaging 9\u201317 lb (4.1\u20137.7 kg) and females 7\u201312 lb (3.2\u20135.4 kg). [11] [12]\nThe British Shorthair's coat is one of the breed's defining features. It is very dense but does not have an undercoat; thus, the texture is plush rather than woolly or fluffy, with a firm, \"crisp\" pile that breaks noticeably over the cat's body as it moves. [4] [10]\nAlthough the British Blue remains the most familiar variant, British Shorthairs have been developed in many other colours and patterns. Black, blue, white, red, cream, silver, golden and\u2014most recently\u2014cinnamon and fawn are accepted by all official standards, either solid or in colourpoint , tabby , shaded and bicolour patterns; the GCCF, FIFe and TICA also accept chocolate and its dilute lilac, disallowed in the CFA standard. [13] All colours and patterns also have tortoiseshell variants. [10]\nThe Tabby patterns include: [14] Classic Tabby, Mackerel Tabby, Spotted & Ticked Tabby. The non-tabby patterns include: Tortoiseshell, Bi-Colour, Van patterns Bi-Colour & White, Smoke, Tipped & Colourpointed.\nBritish Shorthair's nose color: black, cherry red, brick red; a circle of black nasal line on the periphery.\n4-month-old golden shaded male kitten\n5-month-old lilac female kitten\nBlue bicolour adult male\n6-month-old silver classic tabby male kitten\nBritish shorthair in silver coat octa\nBritish Shorthairs are an easygoing and dignified breed, not as active and playful as many, but sweet-natured and devoted to their owners, making them a favorite of animal trainers. They tend to be safe around other pets and children since they will tolerate a fair amount of physical interaction, but as a rule do not like to be picked up or carried. They require only minimal grooming and take well to being kept as indoor-only cats; however, they can be prone to obesity unless care is taken with their diet. [4] [11] They are quiet and vigilant, but if they trust their owners, they will silently follow the owners\u2019 activities and stay with them. British Shorthair cats are not lap cats. They are more accustomed to staying beside people than squatting on people\u2019s laps. Similarly, they prefer the feeling of having their feet on the ground. They have low voice and a moderate activity level. When there is no one at home, they will stay at home quietly and wait for their owners to come back. [15] [16]\nThe UK breed committee considers the British Shorthair a long-lived cat, with a life expectancy of 14\u201320 years. [17] Vet clinic data from England shows a median lifespan of 11.8 years. [18] Swedish insurance data puts the median lifespan of the breed at > 12.5 years. 82% of British Shorthairs lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more. [19]\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be a problem in the breed. A Danish prevalence study with more than 329 cats showed that 20.4% of males and 2.1% of the females had HCM. On top of this 6.4% of males and 3.5% of females were judged to be equivocal. [20] HCM testing of males used for breeding is now mandatory for breeders organised under the Danish Fife member, Felis Danica. [21]\nThe breed is thought to be at high risk of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). [22] A DNA test lab has noted a significant decrease of the PKD mutations in tested populations. Carrier frequency is now at 1%.

We\u2019re spoiled, entitled, and hopelessly glued to our smartphones. We demand participation trophies, can\u2019t find jobs, and live with our parents until we\u2019re 30. You know the punchlines by now.\nBut is the millennial hate justified? Have we dropped the generational baton, or was it a previous generation, the so-called baby boomers, who actually ruined everything?\nThat\u2019s the argument Bruce Gibney makes in his 2017 book A Generation of Sociopaths: How the Baby Boomers Betrayed America . The boomers, according to Gibney, have committed \u201cgenerational plunder,\u201d pillaging the nation\u2019s economy, repeatedly cutting their own taxes, financing two wars with deficits, ignoring climate change, presiding over the death of America\u2019s manufacturing core, and leaving future generations to clean up the mess they created.\nI spoke to Gibney about these claims, and why he thinks the baby boomers have wrecked America.\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\nWho are the baby boomers?\nThe baby boomers are conventionally defined as people born between 1946 and 1964. But I focus on the first two-thirds of boomers because their experiences are pretty homogeneous: They were raised after the war and so have no real experience of trauma or the Great Depression or even any deprivation at all. More importantly, they never experienced the social solidarity that unfolded during war time and that helped produce the New Deal.\nBut it\u2019s really the white middle-class boomers who exemplify all the awful characteristics and behaviors that have defined this generation. They became a majority of the electorate in the early \u201980s, and they fully consolidated their power in Washington by January 1995. And they\u2019ve basically been in charge ever since.\nSo how have they broken the country?\nWell, the damage done to the social fabric is pretty self-evident. Just look around and notice what\u2019s been done. On the economic front, the damage is equally obvious, and it trickles down to all sorts of other social phenomena. I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in an ocean of numbers and data here (that\u2019s in the book), but think of it this way: I\u2019m 41, and when I was born, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio was about 35 percent. It\u2019s roughly 103 percent now \u2014 and it keeps rising.\nThe boomers inherited a rich, dynamic country and have gradually bankrupted it. They habitually cut their own taxes and borrow money without any concern for future burdens. They\u2019ve spent virtually all our money and assets on themselves and in the process have left a financial disaster for their children.\nWe used to have the finest infrastructure in the world. The American Society of Civil Engineers thinks there\u2019s something like a $4 trillion deficit in infrastructure in deferred maintenance. It\u2019s crumbling, and the boomers have allowed it to crumble. Our public education system has steadily degraded as well, forcing middle-class students to bury themselves in debt in order to get a college education.\nThen of course there\u2019s the issue of climate change, which they\u2019ve done almost nothing to solve. But even if we want to be market-oriented about this, we can think of the climate as an asset, which has degraded over time thanks to the inaction and cowardice of the boomer generation. Now they didn\u2019t start burning fossil fuels, but by the 1990s the science was undeniable. And what did they do? Nothing.\nWhy hasn\u2019t this recklessness been checked by the political system? Is it as simple as the boomers took over and used power to enrich themselves without enough resistance from younger voters?\nWell, most of our problems have not been addressed because that would require higher taxes and therefore a sense of social obligation to our fellow citizens. But again, the boomers seem to have no appreciation for social solidarity.\nBut to answer your question more directly, the problem is that dealing with these problems has simply been irrelevant to the largest political class in the country \u2014 the boomers. There\u2019s nothing conspiratorial about that. Politicians respond to the most important part of the electorate, and that\u2019s been the boomers for decades. And it just so happens that the boomers are not socially inclined and have a ton of maladaptive personality characteristics.\nIt\u2019s interesting that Ronald Reagan is elected right around the time that boomers become a majority of the electorate. Reagan himself wasn\u2019t a boomer, but it was boomers who put him into office. And this is when we get this wave of neoliberalism that essentially guts the public sector and attempts to privatize everything.\nRight. Starting with Reagan, we saw this national ethos which was basically the inverse of JFK\u2019s \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\u201d This gets flipped on its head in a massive push for privatized gain and socialized risk for big banks and financial institutions. This has really been the dominant boomer economic theory, and it\u2019s poisoned what\u2019s left of our public institutions.\nSo what\u2019s your explanation for the awfulness of the boomers? What made them this way?\nI think there were a number of unusual influences, some of which won't be repeated, and some of which may have mutated over the years. I think the major factor is that the boomers grew up in a time of uninterrupted prosperity. And so they simply took it for granted. They assumed the economy would just grow three percent a year forever and that wages would go up every year and that there would always be a good job for everyone who wanted it.\nThis was a fantasy and the result of a spoiled generation assuming things would be easy and that no sacrifices would have to be made in order to preserve prosperity for future generations.\nI\u2019ve always seen the boomers as a generational trust-fund baby: They inherited a country they had no part in building, failed to appreciate it, and seized on all the benefits while leaving nothing behind.\nI think that\u2019s exactly right. They were born into great fortune and had a blast while they were on top. But what have they left behind?\nSomething that doesn\u2019t get discussed enough is how hostile so many of these boomers are to science. It\u2019s not hard to connect this aversion to facts to some of these disastrous social policies.\nThis is a generation that is dominated by feelings, not by facts. The irony is that boomers criticize millennials for being snowflakes, for being too driven by feelings. But the boomers are the first big feelings generation. They\u2019re highly motivated by feelings and not persuaded by facts. And you can see this in their policies.\nTake this whole fantasy about trickle-down economics. Maybe it was worth a shot, but it doesn\u2019t work. We know it doesn\u2019t work. The evidence is overwhelming. The experiment is over. And yet they\u2019re still clinging to this dogma, and indeed the latest tax bill is the latest example of that.\nTime after time, when facts collided with feelings, the boomers chose feelings.\nWhat\u2019s the most egregious thing the boomers have done in your opinion?\nI'll give you something abstract and something concrete. On an abstract level, I think the worst thing they\u2019ve done is destroy a sense of social solidarity, a sense of commitment to fellow citizens. That ethos is gone and it\u2019s been replaced by a cult of individualism. It\u2019s hard to overstate how damaging this is.\nOn a concrete level, their policies of under-investment and debt accumulation have made it very hard to deal with our most serious challenges going forward. Because we failed to confront things like infrastructure decay and climate change early on, they\u2019ve only grown into bigger and more expensive problems. When something breaks, it\u2019s a lot more expensive to fix than it would have been to just maintain it all along.\nSo where does that leave us?\nIn an impossible place. We\u2019re going to have to make difficult choices between, say, saving Social Security and Medicare and saving arctic ice sheets. We'll have fewer and fewer resources to deal with these issues. And I actually think that over the next 100 years, absent some major technological innovation like de-carbonization, which is speculative at this point, these actions will actually just kill people.\nI hear you, man, and I\u2019m with you on almost all of this, but I always return to a simple point: If millennials and Gen Xers actually voted in greater numbers, the boomers could\u2019ve been booted out of power years ago.\nI think that\u2019s fair. But given how large the boomer demographic is, it really wasn\u2019t possible for millennials to unseat the boomers until a few years ago. And of course there are many issues with voting rights. But that\u2019s not a complete excuse.\nMore than voting, though, millennials have to run for office because people have to be excited about the person they\u2019re voting for. We need people in office with a different outlook, who see the world differently. Boomers don\u2019t care about how the country will look in 30 or 40 years, but millennials do, and so those are the people we need in power.\nI guess the big question is, can we recover from this? Can we pay the bill the boomers left us?\nI think we can, but it\u2019s imperative that we start sooner than later. After 2024 or so, it will get really hard to do anything meaningful. In fact, I think the choices might become so difficult that even fairly good people will get wrapped up in short-term self-interest.\nSo if we unseat the boomers from Congress, from state legislatures, and certainly from the presidency over the next three to seven years, then I think we can undo the damage. But that will require a much higher tax rate and a degree of social solidarity that the country hasn\u2019t seen in over 50 years.\nThat will not be easy, and there\u2019s no way around the fact that millennials will have to sacrifice in ways the boomers refused to sacrifice, but that\u2019s where we are \u2014 and these are the choices we face.\nThis article was originally published on December 20, 2017."], "citation_links": ["https://www.vox.com/2017/12/20/16772670/baby-boomers-millennials-congress-debt"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_99746c45-acb2-451e-b231-4b66b089ae75"}

Both of these are the base of geometry. When two lines meet at a point, they form an angle where the point is said to be the vertex and lines are the arms.\n- The two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes are formed using point, lines and angles.\nShapes are nothing but simple geometric figures which have a specific boundary, and interior and exterior surface area. In geometry, we can learn various shapes and their properties. Students are introduced with geometry in their classes with basic shapes and terms.\nGeometrical shapes are the figures which represent the forms of different objects. Some figures are two-dimensional, whereas some are three-dimensional shapes. The two-dimensional figures lie on only the x-axis and y-axis, but 3d shapes lie on the x, y and z axes. The z-axis shows the height of the object. As we have already discussed in the introduction, there are different shapes defined in geometry.\nTo draw or design any of these figures start with a line or a line segment or a curve. Depending upon the number and arrangement of these lines, we get different types of shapes and figures like a triangle, a figure where three line segments are connected, a pentagon (five-line segments) and so on. But every figure is not a complete figure.\nHere is the list of different geometric shapes that we learn in geometry.\n|Two Dimensional Shapes||Three Dimensional Shapes|\nGo through the different types of shapes in geometry along with definitions here.\nTriangle is a polygon, which is made of three sides and consists of three edges and three vertices. Also, the sum of its internal angles equals to 180 o .\nLocus of all points at a fixed distance from a reference central point is called a Circle.\nSquare is a quadrilateral where all the four sides and angles are equal and the angles at all the vertices are equal to 90\u00b0 each.\nA quadrilateral has two pairs of opposite sides equal in length and interior angles are at the right angles.\nA parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides and opposite angles are equal in measure.\nThese are made up of line segments and no curves. They are enclosed structures based on different lengths of sides and different angles.\n|Names of 2D Geometric Shapes||Figure|\n|Circle|\n|Semicircle|\n|Oval|\n|Triangle|\n|Square|\n|Rectangle|\n|Parallelogram|\n|Rhombus|\n|Trapezium|\n|Kite|\n|Pentagon|\n|Hexagon|\n|Heptagon|\n|Octagon|\n|Nonagon|\n|Decagon|\nMost of the three-dimensional shapes can be defined as a set of vertices, lines that connect the vertices and faces enclosed by these lines including obtained interior points. For many three dimensional shapes, faces are two-dimensional. Also, some shapes in three dimensions have curves surfaces. In three dimensions, the primary shapes are:\n- Cube\n- Cuboid\n- Cone\n- Cylinder\n- Sphere\nThese can be better understood with the help of the table given below:\n|Names of 3D geometric shapes||Figure||Definition|\n|Cube|| A cube is a three-dimensional shape which has 6 faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges. The faces of the cube are square. |\nExample: A Rubik\u2019s cube\n|Cuboid|| A cuboid is also three dimensional solid having 6 faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges but the faces of the cuboid are in a rectangular shape. |\nExample: Matchbox\n|Cone|| A cone is a solid which has a circular base and narrows smoothly from the surface to the top at a point called apex or vertex. |\nExample: An icecream cone\n|Cylinder|| A cylinder is a 3d solid shape that has two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface. It has no vertex. |\nExample: Gas cylinder\n|Sphere|| A sphere is a round shape in a 3d plane, whose radius is extended to three dimensions (x-axis, y-axis and z-axis). |\nExample: Ball\nA point is a small dot which is the starting point of a line segment. By definition, a line segment is a part of a line in which a narrow lane is connecting two points within a line. Different numbers of line segments give us different figures and such figures may be either open figures or closed shapes or figures.\nGeometric shapes such as a square, rectangles, and triangles are a few basic 2D shapes. These figures are collectively called polygons. A polygon is any flat shape or plane on a surface of a paper. They have a finite closed boundary made up of a fixed number of line segments and are called sides of the polygon. Each side meets at a common point called corners (vertex).\nSuch bounded geometric shapes like polygons are called closed figures. A boundary of a closed figure is not only made of line segments but also of curves. Hence, a closed figure can be defined as any geometric shape which starts and ends at the same point to form a boundary by line segments or by curves.\nOpen figures are incomplete shapes. To sketch a closed figure one has to meet both the starting point and ending point. Open figures are also depicted by using line segments or by curves but at least the lines will be discontinuous. An open figure\u2019s starting and endpoints are different.\nIn our daily existence, we may observe different shapes which look exactly the same as some three-dimensional geometric shapes.\nApart from the above examples, there are other objects in our surroundings such as traffic cones, Rubik\u2019s cubes, pyramids and so on. Observe the below figure, to understand the different shapes that relate to geometric shapes.\nQ.1: Find the open figure from the following.\nQ.2: How many sides does a decagon have?\n- 8\n- 9\n- 10\n- 11\nAnswer: The correct answer is C.\nA decagon has 10 sides and 10 vertices.\nQ.3. Is a cone a two-dimensional shape or a three-dimensional shape?\nAnswer: A cone is a three-dimensional solid shape with a circular base and a single vertex.

However, it is unclear how insects deal with sunlight in their eyes.", "references": ["Written by Nancy Miorelli\nEyes are remarkable structures that have evolved independently at least three times. The most obvious advantage of eyes is that they help us understand the world around us by absorbing what is essentially data, which our brains then decode to tell us there\u2019s a bus coming and to get out of the way.\nWell, the thing about evolution is that it doesn\u2019t have to work perfectly \u2013 just good enough, like your perfectly average C student. The overall effectiveness and subsequent modifications to the compound eye is summarized very well by Nilsson.\nIt is only a small exaggeration to say that evolution seems to be fighting a desperate battle to improve a basically disastrous design.\nNilsson 1989\nSo, the benefit that the compound eye gives the fly is that the fly can see. It lets the fly know if something is coming towards it, where the fly is positioned in its environment, what\u2019s there, and tells the fly that it\u2019s moving in relation to other things.\nBut I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s not *really* what the question is asking. So let\u2019s get a couple things out of the way before we talk about what compound eyes do and some modifications that flies have made to them over the years.\n- Evolution isn\u2019t picky about how things get done. So light sensing organs pop up and stick around because organisms that have them usually get less dead than things that don\u2019t.\n- That is, of course, if the organism needs to see. Eyes are usually the first things to disappear if you live in caves. Or if you\u2019re a fly maggot that invests its early days face first eating rotting corpses.\n- It\u2019s not just flies that have compound eyes. All insects that have eyes have compound eyes. Many insects cheat and have both simple light sensing receptors and compound eyes.\n- There are about 150,000 described species of described true flies (Diptera) with an estimated total number of fly species to be around 240,000. So, this is going to be very generalized and does not at all encompass every organism.\nSo let\u2019s talk about the compound eye and how insects and specifically flies have tailored it to fit specific needs.\nThe compound eye is nothing like the human eye. We have two eyeballs and in each one we have a lens that focuses the image on our retina. Cones help us see color and rods help us see in the dark. The optic nerve is the cable that runs from the eyeball \u2013 the data center \u2013 to our brain \u2013 the interpreter. It\u2019s hard to talk about what the resolution of the human eye actually is for lots of reasons (whichVsauce explains below). Basically, the resolution is pretty good and, all things considered, doesn\u2019t require that much physical space to produce.\nThe compound eye is made up of many \u201commatidia\u201d, the basic units that the insect eye is comprised of. Each one is kind of like an eyeball in the fact that it has a lens which focuses light and has pigments (opsins) for detecting color. One advantage of this system is that the image is projected in each ommatidum right side up, unlike our eyes. Insects with large, globular eyes practically have a 360 panoramic view of the world and don\u2019t have to turn their heads to get a sense of their environment. This setup, for most insects, removes obvious blind spots and is part of the reason flies can see you coming and dodge your unsuccessful swatting attempts.\nResolution of the compound eye is achieved in different ways.\n- You can just add more units. That\u2019s basically what the dragonfly did with all 30,000+ ommatidia it has. Some subterranean insects only have 20.\n- You can make bigger units.\n- You can modify your units. This has been done in a few groups and there are definitely some trade offs.\nFlies that rely heavily on their vision, for the most part, have cashed in on all of the options. House flies ( Musca domestica ) have a moderate amount of ommatidia , but males have more ommatidia (~3,500) than females (~3,400) and bigger eyes, suggesting that vision plays an important role in mate determination. In fact, this pattern is readily seen in two other families of flies, the Flesh Flies (Sarcophagidae) and the Blow Flies (Calliophoridae). House flies were at the lower end of the spectrum with some Blow Files coming in closer to the ~5,500 ommatidia Honey Bees have. While this isn\u2019t the 30,000 that Dragonflies have, each ommatidium of a House Fly, Flesh Fly, or Blow Fly is bigger than that of a dragonfly. Plus they still have a lot more than the 2,000 American Cockroaches have and the 800 that Drosophila have. So we\u2019ll call it a nice middle ground.\nAll flies have a rhabdom in each ommatidium. This is basically what does the \u201cseeing\u201d in an insect. Light is focused through the lens and onto the rhabdom and photopigments are stimulated. In most insect eyes, each ommatidium acts like a single \u201cpixel\u201d that the insect can see. While it\u2019s not actually a \u201cpixel\u201d, for simplicity it works as a pretty good analogy. True flies (the order Diptera) have their rhabdom split into seven parts. It\u2019s a pretty complicated system, but basically flies can increase their resolution by a factor of 7 without increasing the size of their eye.\nThe take home point is that compound eyes are a bad design for resolution because to get more, you have to take up a lot of space. And space isn\u2019t a commodity on a small animal like an insect, so insects have to get crafty.\nInsects can\u2019t focus on objects by changing the shape of their lens or the position of their lens, so they have to move closer or farther away to see things clearly. They sacrifice depth perception and the ability to focus to see a lot of stuff (wide-angle vision) and perceive contrast. Therefore, something called visual acuity is very important. Basically, the greater their visual acuity the more detail the insect can see on an object. Obviously, the more detail you can see, the better. Some insects are at the maximum limits of their resolution so they have some other nifty tricks up their sleeves. This is where sight lines come in.\nSome insects need high visual acuity for mating or for catching prey. Therefore, certain areas of their eyes are allocated to see things with greater acuity while sacrificing the image quality of other parts of their eyes. Dragonflies have great visual acuity on the top and middle of their eyes. This helps them snatch their prey. Male flies, in addition to having bigger eyes, have more specialized acuity zones than their female counterparts. One Hover Fly in particular ( Syritta pipiens ) can see the female at a distance where she can\u2019t see him. He literally stalks her. Flies aren\u2019t known for being romantic.\nHumans are pretty good at seeing colors. We can see about 10 million different colors with three types of cones. Insects and crustaceans use opsins to detect light. Mantis shrimp have 16 opsins and were previously thought to hold the world record, being able to see trillions of colors, until some dragonflies butted in. Certain species of dragonflies were found to have over 30 opsins, but we are uncertain of their specific ability to distinguish colors. Using the mantis shrimp , the color differentiation capabilities of the compound eye is being reconsidered. The big question here is, \u201cwhy is it important to see all these different colors?\u201d. In both of these cases, these animals are fast predators and need to be able to distinguish edible things from not edible things. Quick color discretion is important, but maybe determining the difference between #75D1FF and #83D6FF isn\u2019t. In fact, if these two weren\u2019t labeled, and you were shown one at a time, could you tell the difference? Technically your eyes can, but your brain doesn\u2019t, especially if you don\u2019t have words to describe the different colors .\nOkay so some compound eyes can (probably) distinguish more colors than us, but many insects are blind to red and orange light. However, insects can see UV light while we cannot. Their resolution may be worse than ours, but they can see harmful and damaging UV wavelengths. This is used by pollinators (many of which are pollinators like hover flies !) to navigate to flowers and for complex mating signals , but can also lead them to their death . Insects can also see polarized light, and many use it to navigate and for mating.\nInsects that are completely nocturnal modified the structure of the compound eye. Normally, the inside of the ommatidium is lined with pigment cells. This prevents light seeping into the adjacent ommatida. Usually this is good because the more light that floods in makes your resolution shoot down the tubes. But night flying insects don\u2019t have these pigment cells, so the light does flood the ommatidia which allows them to perceive more at night but at a lower resolution. Also, while the rhabdom usually sits right under the structures in one ommitidia in day flying insects, in night flying insects the rhabdom is disconnected and separated by a clear zone. This allows light from adjacent ommatidia to stimulate one rhabdom to make a better image.\nMany little gnats and mosquitoes are crepuscular meaning they fly at dawn and at dusk but flies generally have eye modifications for frolicking around in the sunlight. Normally they\u2019d be out of luck seeing once the sun dipped below the horizon, but flies have that 7 way split rhabdom. This helps them fly in low light conditions because the 7 parts of the rhabdom are separated and act in a similiar manner to the rhabdoms separated from the ommatidia by the clear zone. Specifically for gnats and mosquitoes, it gives them an extra 15 or so minutes before dawn and after sunset. This doesn\u2019t seem like much for us, but it gives them a small window to swarm, mate, and feed without being incredibly visible to predators.\nMost often seen in dragonflies (but some flies have this as well), the top part of the eye is a darker color than the rest of the eye. This has been suggested that it acts like a pair of sunglasses and protects their eyes from direct sunlight. It\u2019s also been suggested for dragonflies and owlflies , that this dark spot helps the insect see prey flying against the blue sky.\nLots of flies have crazy color patterns on their eyes. We\u2019re not sure of the exact purpose. For some it may play a part in mating. Horse Flies (Tabanidae) probably use it as a convenient color filter. Horse flies are blood feeders and the things they attack are big, bulky, grass feeders that are usually surrounded by lots of vegetation. By having green eyes, Horse Flies effectively put on green glasses that make the background appear grey and their hosts stand out from the background.\nSometimes evolution just doesn\u2019t care if you can see and it\u2019s only important how sexy you are. That\u2019s what happened to the stalk eyed fly. The outrageous stalks that the males carry around actual hinder their flying capabilities but they can still see relatively well .\nCompound eyes aren\u2019t really the greatest because it\u2019s hard to compensate for the low resolution. However, insects and flies specifically have some pretty nifty tricks to compensate. Compound eyes don\u2019t really let insects see red or orange light, but insects can see well into the UV range and even use polarized light for navigation.\nBelu\u0161i\u010d G, Pirih P, Stavenga DG.

Additionally, inflation is a key factor that affects the euro's value, with countries with high levels of inflation relative to other countries normally seeing their currency depreciate.", "references": ["Updated January 31, 2022\nReviewed by Charles Potters\nFact checked by\nTrading euro-based currency pairs requires following events that can have a major impact on the euro (also known as the \"common currency\"), which can be a daunting task for foreign exchange (FX) traders.\nCurrently, the euro is the official currency of 19 of the 27 member countries that comprise the European Union (EU). These 19 member countries form the euro area, or eurozone , which has an aggregate GDP of over $13 trillion (as of 2019).\n1\n2\nThere are hundreds of economic reports that come out of the eurozone each year relevant to the foreign exchange market , but how does one know which economic reports will be the ones that move markets?\nThe European Union has 27 members, but few are large enough to generate economic reports that really affect the currency. The eurozone accounts for over 85% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the European Union (EU).\n2\n3\nGermany, France, Italy, and Spain together represent three-quarters of the eurozone's $13.3 trillion GDP.\n2\nSo, if a trader was looking for trade-worthy reports, then the focus should be on those reports that detail these countries' economies. In particular, economic reports coming out of Germany and France tend to be given more weight by FX traders than other countries mainly because these two, now that Brexit has happened, account for nearly 50% of the eurozone's GDP.\n2\nIt is also important to understand that the reports we list in this article are relatively standard across different countries. However, there are a handful that one should follow that emphasize the key areas of:\nInflation is a key factor that affects all currencies, including the euro. In general, countries with high levels of inflation relative to other countries will normally see their currency depreciate so that the prices of goods between countries remain relatively equal. In addition, higher-than-expected inflation will result in the central bank raising interest rates to tame inflation.\nThe key measure of inflation in the eurozone is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This indicator calculates the price of a basket of goods that an average household is likely to purchase. Traders typically follow the Core CPI, which is the normal CPI calculation excluding energy and food prices. Energy and food prices tend to be volatile and can be greatly influenced by temporary supply and demand imbalances, as well as external random factors such as weather, which can distort the CPI number.\nIt is important to note that although the CPI report does have an effect on the euro, its effect is diminished because the eurozone\u2019s CPI Flash Estimate, the French CPI Flash Estimate, and the German Preliminary CPI are released at the end of every month, about two weeks earlier than when the official CPIs are released. So, you may want to keep an eye on various inflation indicators and patterns across multiple regions, especially CPI reports from Germany and France.\nReport to Focus On: ZEW Survey\nAnother way to gauge economic conditions in the eurozone is to look at confidence and sentiment reports. One of the most widely followed sentiment reports is the German ZEW Survey, prepared monthly by the Centre for European Economic Research . The survey asks a sampling of up to 350 financial experts where they see the economy headed over the medium-term horizon. Responses are restricted to positive, no change, or negative. This simple response structure allows the ZEW indicator to clearly reflect whether experts and analysts are optimistic or pessimistic about the economy in the medium term. The survey also queries experts for the eurozone, Japan, Great Britain, and the United States.\n4\nAs with most major indicators, analysts will have forecasts on what they expect the indicator to be. With respect to the ZEW indicator, if the actual ZEW indicator comes in above forecasts, this would translate into a positive effect for the euro while a ZEW below forecasts could put pressure on the common currency. A ZEW number above zero indicates optimism and a number below zero indicates pessimism.\n4\nReport to Focus On: ECB Press Releases\nEvery currency is affected by the monetary policies of its respective central bank. For the euro, that is the European Central Bank (ECB), and decisions regarding interest rates made by the ECB can have a significant impact. Generally, the ECB press conferences tend to be the most important news to follow, because interest rate changes are usually anticipated well in advance by the market. The structure of the press release is two-part. It contains:\n- A prepared statement\n- An open press question period\nThe question period tends to cause the most currency volatility as the answers given by the ECB president can move markets.\nThe press conference is key, because it can give clues about where the ECB President expects the economy to go. If the language of the ECB President appears \"hawkish,\" which means that she seems concerned about inflation, this could result in future rate hikes, which usually causes the euro to appreciate. Alternatively, if the language appears \"dovish,\" which means that she believes inflation is tame, then future rate hikes will tend to be less likely and the euro could depreciate.\nReport to Focus On: Eurozone GDP\nThe next type of report that has a significant influence on the euro are those that inform about the overall economic output of the eurozone. The economic growth and health of an economy are typically measured by the GDP, which is a periodic measure of the value of the total goods and services produced. In general, growth in GDP is a sign that the economy is strong and healthy, which is positive for the currency.\nThe eurozone GDP is a quarterly report prepared by Eurostat and released about two months after the end of the quarter.\n5\nAs you can tell, this makes the report rather untimely, and since analysts have several methods to gauge the strength of the economy, the GDP is usually anticipated in advance. Nevertheless, this report is still significant, and its release does tend to move the currency markets, especially if there is a surprise in the actual release relative to expectations.\nLastly, we'll take a look at the balance of payments, specifically the trade balance and current account . The current account is one of the three accounts that make up the balance of payments for a country (the other two being the financial account and capital account). This report measures how a country interacts with other countries with respect to the trade balance , income payments, and other payments.\nThe current account report is a monthly report, usually given during the second week of each month. When interpreting this report, a current account surplus means there is more capital flowing into the country than there is exiting the country, which is positive for the currency. This occurs when exports exceed imports. A current account deficit means the opposite in that more financial capital is leaving the country than there is coming in. This tends to be negative for the currency. Since Germany and France are two of the largest countries in the eurozone, many traders will focus in on the current account report for these two nations.\nThere are hundreds of economic indicators that can affect the euro. Instead of simply listing reports, an in-depth look at those which are most relevant can prove to be more beneficial when trading the euro.\nSponsored\nInvesting Beyond Dogecoin and Meme Stocks\nOver the last 26 years, fine art has outpaced the S&P 500 by a stunning 131%.

Here's a list of his best performances against every team in the Association.\nESPN\nBy Max Golkin , PSO Asst. Director of Basketball Personnel\nMay 23, 2020\nMay 23, 2020\nInspired by ESPN\u2019s 30 for 30 documentary series \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d, now is the perfect time to compile a list of Jordan\u2019s best games against every team in the NBA. Michael Jordan is widely considered the greatest player of all-time . He\u2019s had more success than any player during his generation and thrived vs. every single team in the league. Let\u2019s take a look at his most outstanding performances against every NBA team.\nApril 16th, 1987 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThe \u201986-\u201987 season was MJ\u2019s breakout year, averaging a career-best 37.1 points per game (which hasn\u2019t been matched since). He was forced to carry a talent-limited Bulls team to a 40-42 record and the eighth seed in the East that season. Jordan exploded in this game against Atlanta, scoring 61 points (tying his regular season career-high at that point) on 22-38 shooting, adding 10 rebounds, and four steals. The Hawks still found a way to win the game. Atlanta outscored the Bulls 37-23 in the final period to grab the win, their 57th of the season. Hall of Famer Dominque Wilkins went for 34 points.\nApril 20th, 1986 \u2013 Eastern Conference First Round Game 3\nIn his second season, Jordan missed the majority of the year with a broken foot. He was able to get back on the court in time for the Playoffs, with his Bulls meeting up with the top-seeded Boston Celtics led by Larry Bird in the first round. Chicago was no match for the Celtics, who would eventually win the title, but that didn\u2019t stop Jordan from putting on a show.\nAfter a 49-point performance in Game 1, he followed that up in Game 2 in Boston with a Playoff career-high 63 points as they went to double-overtime . Unfortunately, Chicago lost the game, 135-131, but Jordan\u2019s performance still stands as the most points scored by ANY player in NBA Postseason history. However, Chicago would get swept in three straight games.\nFebruary 26th, 1987 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nBefore the Nets were in Brooklyn, they called New Jersey home where Michael Jordan had one of the greatest plays of his career . Jordan\u2019s greatest game against the Nets came during a 128-113 victory with MJ exploding for 58 points that included a near perfect 26-for-27 effort from the free throw line. The GOAT didn\u2019t have much help from his supporting cast that night as Chicago\u2019s next leading scoring John Paxson only added 16 points.\nDecember 29th, 2001- Regular Season Game\nAfter establishing himself as the unquestioned best player in the game, Michael Jordan took a three-year hiatus before taking his talents to Washington D.C. to play for the Wizards. While still maintaining a scoring average over 20 PPG in DC, he was essentially a shell of his former MVP self. However, he managed to score over 45 points once during his time in the nation\u2019s capital and it was against the only other organization he would end up aligning with besides the Wizards and the Bulls.\nJanuary 19th, 2002- Regular Season Game\nJordan made his highly-anticipated return to the United Center in Wizards blue and white. It was his first time in the visiting locker room. When the starting lineups were announced, Jordan received a three-minute long ovation as Chicago remembered the iconic moments he provided. Though Jordan would only score 16 points in his return to the Windy City, this game deserves a spot on this list due to its significance.\nIn Jordan\u2019s interview after the game, he stated, \u201cwhen the crowd started that whole thing, it made it tough for me to play,\u201d Jordan admitted. \u201cI had a tough time playing against Chicago. It\u2019s like playing a relative, in a sense. It\u2019s not as intense, you\u2019re not quite as motivated.\u201d Jordan\u2019s 16.2 PPG against the Bulls over six games is by far the lowest average against any team he\u2019s ever faced.\nMarch 28th, 1990 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nOne could understandably choose \u201cThe Shot\u201d as MJ\u2019s best game, but putting up almost 70 points in a game deserves recognition too. Considering Michael Jordan scored a career-best 69 points in the Bulls 117-113 overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1990, it deserved to represent this spot on the list. Jordan shot a ludicrous 23-for-37 from the field and was 21-for-23 from the free-throw line as he put together an incredibly efficient scoring attack all game.\nApril 7th, 1990 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAlthough the Mavericks were never a rival of the Bulls, that didn\u2019t stop Michael from torching them for 43 points during their regular season matchup in 1990. MJ put up 43 points in 40 minutes on 15-26 shooting from the field and going 3-for-5 from three-point land. In 25 games against the Mavs, MJ averaged 27.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, & 5.5 APG.\nFebruary 4th, 1996 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nWith Chicago\u2019s record-breaking season on the line every night, the Bulls were down by 31 points late in the second quarter. However, when Michael Jordan is on the opposing team, no lead is safe. He scored 23 points in the third quarter alone as he brought the Bulls back and eventually took the lead. Unfortunately, they would end up losing 1 of their 10 games that season 105-98, but Jordan\u2019s second-half dominance was one for the books.\nMay 27th, 1989 \u2013 NBA Eastern Conference Finals Game 3\nWith the 1989 ECF series tied one-a-piece, the Bulls had home-court advantage for Game 3. Jordan dropped 46 points on 16-for-26 shooting and went 14-for-15 from the free throw line. Jordan added seven rebounds, dished five assists, and stole the ball five times in the Bulls\u2019 99-97 victory. Despite MJ\u2019s heroics to take a 2-1 lead in the series, however, the Bulls would lose the next three games and the series.\nNovember 24th, 1992 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThe most points Michael Jordan scored in a game against the Warriors was when he dropped 49 points in 1992 at Golden State. Jordan shot 18-of-30 from the field, including 1-of-3 from three-point range, and 12-of-14 from the free throw line. He also recorded five rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block in 44 minutes in the 101-92 Bulls victory. 20 years later, the Warriors were beginning to build the only dynasty that was able to win more games in a season than Jordan\u2019s Bulls.\nJanuary 3rd, 1996 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThis matchup featured the number one overall pick of the 1984 draft and the 3rd overall pick: Hakeem \u201cthe Dream\u201d Olajuwon vs. Michael \u201cAir\u201d Jordan. The Finals matchup fans never got to see. The 2x reigning champ Houston Rockets facing off against the previous 3x reigning champ Chicago Bulls before Jordan retired in 1993.\nMJ let it be known in this game that the Rockets have some competition if they want to 3-peat as he almost finished with 40 points in a near-blowout against Houston. The Rockets failed to beat the Sonics in the West Playoffs so they couldn\u2019t even defend their title against the Bulls later that year.\nApril 13th, 1989 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThe Chicago Bulls were taking on the Indiana Pacers late in the 1988-89 season, with Chicago vying for playoff positioning and the Pacers just playing out the rest of their schedule. As a temporary Point Guard, Jordan posted a monster triple-double, scoring 47 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds but the Bulls still lost by 4.\nNovember 21st, 1997 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAs he was getting into his mid-30\u2019s, Michael Jordan continued to play phenomenal during the 1997-98 regular season as he won his fifth MVP . On this November night, he scored 49 points against the Clippers in Los Angeles. MJ played a total of 52 minutes in the game, helping the Bulls secure the double-overtime win with Scottie Pippen out of action.\nJune 5th, 1991 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 2\nIn the NBA Finals, MJ displayed all the tools that made him one of the most complete basketball players on the planet \u2013 while sharing the court with Magic Johnson. After struggling in Game 1, Air Jordan responded with 33 points on an incredible 83.3 FG% to go along with 13 assists, 7 rebounds, 1 block, and 2 steals. The Bulls rode the momentum of this game to win the next three games, as Michael Jordan celebrated the first Championship of his career a week later.\nNov. 30th, 1995 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nMichael Jordan\u2019s highest-scoring game against the Grizzlies came in Vancouver on Nov. 30, 1995. He scored 29 points on 14-for-26 shooting from the field and 1-for-2 from the free-throw line. Jordan saved his best for last, leading the Bulls to a comeback win by scoring 19 points in the game\u2019s final six minutes. Besides facing Chicago, the two franchises Jordan struggled most against throughout his career were Vancouver (22.7 PPG) and Toronto (20.5 PPG), the NBA\u2019s only Canadian teams.\nApril 29th, 1992 \u2013 Eastern Conference First Round Game 3\nThe Bulls were leading the Heat 2-0 in the series of the 1992 Playoffs 1st Round and looking to close things out in Miami. Heading into the fourth quarter, Chicago trailed 80-79. Not only did Jordan have an amazing performance, but he and Pippen were fantastic as a duo. The two players combined to score 87 points with 56 coming from Jordan as they won the game 119-114 and eliminated the Heat from the postseason.\nFebruary 16th, 1989 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nWith the Bucks leading the Bulls by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter, Michael Jordan displayed the brilliance everyone knew he was capable of. Jordan hit the GOAT-mode switch and dropped 27 points in that final period to rack up 50 overall, to go along with eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals, and it\u2019s even more impressive considering how he did it. Despite trailing for the entire second half, the game-winner came from Michael Jordan\u2019s hands as he knocked down a mid-range jumper with one second left on the clock.\nApril 3rd, 1998 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAs people could see from the documentary, Michael Jordan was on a mission during his \u201cLast Dance\u201d season. The Bulls matchup with the Timberwolves was a great example of Jordan showing his masterful offensive game. MJ dropped 41 points on 16-25 shooting from the field as the Bulls beat the Timberwolves 107-93. \u2018Air Jordan\u2019 can be seen getting buckets from all over the court in the highlights of his excellent performance.\nMarch 28th, 1995 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nMichael Jordan made it clear multiple times throughout his career that he shines brightest on the biggest stage. There is no bigger stage in the NBA than Madison Square Garden in the most populated city in the country. Jordan had many significant performances against the Knicks, but his most memorable game came just five games after he announced \u201cI\u2019m Back\u201d in 1995. With a star-studded group in attendance, MJ put on a show, dropping 55 points, and came away with the game-winning assist as the Bulls won 113-111.\nMay 27th, 1996 \u2013 Eastern Conference Finals Game 6\nThe Bulls went into Game 4 in Orlando with a 3-0 series lead, needing just one win to sweep the Magic out of the playoffs. While Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Penny Hardaway each had good games with 28 points a piece, Michael Jordan was on another level. He dropped 45 points on 16-for-23 shooting from the field, giving the Bulls a 106-101 victory and closing out the series, officially avenging their only postseason series loss after 1991.\nJanuary 13th, 1996 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nEntering this game, Chicago was 29-3 while the 76ers were a dreadful 7-25, so it was pretty clear who was likely to win. The real question was by how much, and how much would MJ score in the victory? The answer: Jordan posted 48 points on 18-28 shooting, and was perfect from line (7-7). The Bulls dominated the Sixers all evening, ending it with a 120-93 victory.\nJune 6th, 1993 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 4\nAfter winning the first two games of the 1993 NBA Finals against the Phoenix Suns, Chicago lost Game 3 in Phoenix and tried to avoid allowing the Suns to tie the series in Game 4. Knowing the importance of the situation, MJ went off for 55 points on 21-for-37 shooting while adding eight rebounds and four assists. The Bulls completed a 111-105 win, taking a commanding 3-1 series lead that they would finish in six games.\nJune 3rd, 1992 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 1 (The Shrug Game)\nWith the media comparing Clyde Drexler to the great Michael Jordan , the GOAT took that disrespect to the court by coming out firing in Game 1. The United Center was buzzing after his third 3-pointer and nearly exploded after his fourth. Then came the fifth, all in the first half. Jordan was truly letting it fly from deep. After hitting his SIXTH three-pointer of the game, Jordan couldn\u2019t help but shrug toward Magic Johnson who was commentating the game, and it became iconic.\nHis six three-pointers were a Finals record for a single half, as was his 35 points. He would finish with 39 on the night as he rested for a large part of the second half of a 33-point victory. Jordan\u2019s Bulls would go on to win the series in six games, establishing him as a back-to-back NBA Champion for the first time.\nNovember 23rd, 1997 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nIn 1997, Jordan scored 33 points against the Kings in a game that Chicago beat Sacramento by a final score of 126-108. Jordan shot 11-19 from the field and went 11-12 from the line. This was about a month into their \u201cLast Dance\u201d season before they really kicked it into gear en route to winning a third straight NBA championship to end his career.\nNovember 13th, 1984 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nIn Michael Jordan\u2019s rookie season, he immediately showed the league what he was truly capable of. The Bulls were 6-2 going into a home game against the Spurs and \u2018Air Jordan\u2019 put on the best performance of his young career thus far by dropping his first of many 40-point games. The Bulls snuck out of Chicago with a 120-117 win and the clear realization that they have a superstar on their squad.\nJune 16th, 1996 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 6\nBefore moving to Oklahoma City, the Thunder franchise was based in Seattle as the Supersonics or simply referred to as the \u201cSonics.\u201d Gary Payton\u2019s squad had quite a few run-ins with Jordan and his Bulls. Michael Jordan would win his first title since returning from baseball during their historic 1995-96 season as he finished it off with 22 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists on Father\u2019s Day as the Chicago Bulls won their fourth Championship in franchise history (all with Jordan).\nNovember 7th, 1995 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAs noted above in the Grizzlies section, Jordan didn\u2019t always play his best when facing Canadian teams. However, he did manage to drop 38 points on two separate occasions against the Raptors. His best all-around performance came early in the 1995-96 season when he led the Bulls to a nine-point victory with an efficient shooting performance (13-for-19 FG) to go alongside a well-balanced five assists, four rebounds, and four steals.\nJune 14th, 1998 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 6\nMichael Jordan\u2019s best game against the Jazz can also be considered his greatest game ever. It may not be the game where he posted the greatest numbers, but the way this one went down will forever be legendary. In Jordan\u2019s last game as a Bull, he was required to shoot an extraordinary 35 shots thanks to an injured Scottie Pippen.\nMJ finished his Bulls career with 45 points and put the finishing touches on the greatest sequence to end a Finals game in NBA history. With the Jazz owning a three-point lead with about 30 seconds left before forcing a Game 7, Jordan scored a quick layup, stole the ball, and capped it off with the the game-winning jumper to earn his sixth and final Championship, reaching unanimous GOAT status."], "citation_links": ["https://prosportsoutlook.com/michael-jordans-best-game-vs-each-nba-team/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_bda3d5e8-788f-42c9-b9cb-426cef898829"}

Is there anything else you would like to know?", "references": ["Box office is one way a film makes its cash: but what are the others?\nI know you\u2019ll have noticed this by now, but it\u2019s definitely called show business for a reason. It\u2019s not show show art, show entertainment or even show exhibitionist impulse. Unless movies make money, the money to make movies would dry up pretty quickly. But where does this money come from?\nActually, that\u2019s an easy one. It comes, almost entirely, from you and me and people like us. The real question should be how does this money get from our back pockets and into the coffers of the big movie studios.\nSome of the pathways are incredibly obvious, some perhaps a little less so. Let\u2019s take a look at 16 of the ways that movies make money.\nI had just started working in a cinema when Jurassic Park was released. The night of those first public screenings, a local news crew came down and poked their cameras into everybody\u2019s faces. I was glad of the poking, though if I remember correctly, my excited babble about Phil Tippet didn\u2019t make the final cut. But our manager did, excitedly chirruping that he hadn\u2019t seen the crowds packed in like this since Grease .\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nGrease.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that there were a lot of hot, sweaty bodies fighting for seats that night. We had over 900 comfy chairs in that cinema, and there was still a scramble for the best ones. It almost makes me feel nostalgic to think of the fuss and fluster. The last time I went to the opening night of a new film and my screening was packed full was Casino Royale, I think, and that was in one of those little box-rooms that make up multiplexes now.\nBut there\u2019s a twist to this tale of blockbusting thunder lizards. Later, when the news team had snuck into the screen to check out Jurassic Park\u2019 s infamous CG FX for themselves, the manager confided that we were actually going to lose money on every single ticket sold.\nThe deal that our cinema chain had made with Universal, or rather Universal and Paramount\u2019s joint distributor UIP as it was then, meant that we were paying them over 100% of every ticket price. Neither UIP or ABC cinemas exist any longer for me to check, but I think it was 105% of every ticket\u2019s value that had to come out of the cinema\u2019s safe and pay for the privilege to screen Jurassic Park. Every adult ticket sold was costing the cinema something like 25p. It was the story of Blue Monday\u2019s floppy disc sleeve all over again.\nBut this, thankfully, was an extreme example.\nA movie\u2019s distributor will typically still keep over half of the ticket price these days, but I doubt they\u2019d get away with asking for the full amount, let alone an overage. The exhibition chains now have enough scale, and the power that footprint brings, and the rise of smaller-screen viewing has been so dramatic, that there\u2019s a limit to how far a distributor might dare to push things.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nFilms don\u2019t just play cinemas on first run, of course, they can linger for a few weeks or months, and often come back around again in repertory houses. I spent some time booking films for rep, and got quite used to the system. The cinema would pledge a \u201cminimum guarantee,\u201d a base fee that would cover at least the cost of shipping the print to and from the venue, and the distributor\u2019s admin cost. Then there\u2019d be a percentage price, sometimes as low as 30%, sometimes higher, and depending on the particular film, how old it was and who was distributing it. The cinema would then pay whichever was higher, the guarantee or the percentage. Minimum guarantees as low as \u00a3100 gave \u2018second run\u2019 cinemas \u2013 like London\u2019s Prince Charles, back in the day \u2013 a relatively low-risk model, and enabled them to weather some proper flops just as long as the overheads of rent, rates, electricity, staff and so on, could be kept low enough.\nGet the best of Den of Geek delivered right to your inbox!\nIn a multiplex, where the overheads will tend to be quite steep and the number of flops can actually be surprisingly high, ticket prices alone just wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep the fat cats at the top of the chain as well-fed as they\u2019d like. Selling films just isn\u2019t enough to make big business out of selling films.\nVarious cinemas have tried all sorts of bad ideas to cut overheads, from underpaying the staff and keeping them on booby-trapped zero-hour contracts, to letting more or less anybody run the projection booth. I\u2019m sure these have all had some effect, and kept the cats\u2019 cream pouring, but there\u2019s a limit to how much you can cut away before the body dies.\nSo the concession stand becomes incredibly important to the cinema. Those overpriced popcorns, sodas and fat, fattening bags of delicious, deferred arterial congestion are stacked high with price mark-ups, the better to make a cinema into a money-making enterprise.\nIncidentally, if you want to bring in your own, more realistically priced food from the outside, it\u2019s unlikely your cinema will even try to stop you these days. Cineworld prohibit only hot food and drink that they didn\u2019t sell, making cold wares fair game; Vue ban just hot food, so you don\u2019t even have to worry about your coffee; Odeon prohibit outside food and drink in just their \u2018Lounge\u2019 screens.\nSometimes, the distributor doesn\u2019t want to share the ticket price with the exhibitor, or the exhibitor will refuse to book a film for reasons of their own. The Veronica Mars movie is a good, recent example. It was being issued on VOD at the same time as its big-screen release, with many \u2018free\u2019 digital copies being distributed to its Kickstarter bookers, and so cinemas didn\u2019t have any interest in taking a standard booking for the film.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nIn these cases, the distributor will buy out the screens where the film would play, paying the cinema a flat fee for the run. The distributor would then get to keep 100% of the ticket price \u2013 still a far better deal for the cinemas than that old JP scam.\nThere are two kinds of films that typically get four-walled. One is the smaller, fans-only picture like Darren Lynn Bousman\u2019s The Devil\u2019s Carnival. Bousman took the film on a tour of the US, shouldering the risk by buying out cinemas and selling tickets directly. But he also got to reap the rewards, and the very existence of The Devil\u2019s Carnival 2 speaks volumes.\nThe other is the loss-leader. Arguably, Veronica Mars was one of those. It was never intended, or at least never expected, to make a great pile of cash at the box office, but the four-walled engagements gave the film a theatrical release and all of the benefits to its profile that would bring.\nAs noted, some films are being offered via VOD at the same time as their cinema releases. This is very much the norm with \u2018smaller films\u2019 now, the kind of picture that will play the Curzon or Picturehouse chains. Even those that aren\u2019t released \u2018day and date\u2019 on multiple formats will hop from big screen to small very quickly.\nThe current UK \u2018theatrical window\u2019 is 17 weeks, with the exhibitors expecting wide releases to remain exclusive to cinemas for at least that long. Not because they intend to screen films for the duration, of course, but because they want some perceived distance to the imminent home entertainment release.\n17 weeks seems like no time at all, but I still elect to see films in the cinema. Not because I\u2019m impatient, but because they deserve the respect, and because I want the best effect. I\u2019d still go if the window vanished completely, but I understand that many wouldn\u2019t. Family films in particular would seem prone to this, and I can\u2019t imagine many parents would elect to spend a week\u2019s wages on a trip to the cinema if the same film was hanging out on Amazon for \u00a315.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nThe ill health of bricks and mortar DVD and Blu-ray retail is all relative, of course, and what stores remain might have far less reach than they used to, but they don\u2019t seem to be on the cusp of withering up entirely.\nIf you\u2019ve still got a HMV in your area, and I do not, they\u2019ll no doubt be running one of their X-number-of-discs for X-pounds promotions right at this very moment. It\u2019s something I have taken advantage of many times, but arguably played a large role in eroding the perceived value of a DVD or Blu-ray disc. Ask yourself now what the reasonable price for a film on disc is. Now think about what you get for that money.\nAmazon have recently been arguing with a number of their suppliers about unit prices, and this saw several Disney films, from Muppets Most Wanted to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, unavailable for pre-booking on Amazon\u2019s US site. Come day of release, the titles were there, but Amazon had shut down any pre-sales. If they get their way, they\u2019ll be able to squeeze down the amount of money they pay for each copy and reduce the value of home entertainment sales to the distributors and movie studios even further. Of course, the savings will be passed on to us \u2013 that\u2019s Amazon\u2019s model, they want to shovel huge amounts of turnover at the cheapest prices they can \u2013 but it\u2019s not really a good thing for the movie industry\u2019s overall cashflow situation.\nAfter a film has had its time on the aisle ends and been shuffled into the back catalogue shelves, and after Amazon stop pimping it to you and you\u2019ll have to go searching for it specifically, that movie will soon arrive on television or, increasingly, on an Amazon Prime or Netflix-style subscription streaming service.\nThe various Sky Movies channels make for an interesting study here. They have their high-profile, premiere splashes, with new and big-name films advertised and given good slots on the schedule. Then they fill up their schedule with\u2026 other films. Of all kinds. When licensing films to screen, they\u2019ll tend to buy them in packages.\nSay, for example, they\u2019re making a deal to screen Guardians Of The Galaxy. Okay, say Disney, we\u2019ll license that to you in a package of 20 films, each of which you can screen X times in the next 12 months. You\u2019ll get Guardians , you\u2019ll get Iron Man and Iron Man 2, and then you\u2019ll get these other 17 gems, running the gamut from That Darned Cat! to Herbie Fully Loaded. It\u2019s a way that Disney can continue to generate revenue off of their less attractive library stock.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nI cooked those numbers and skewed the titles, but I think you\u2019ll get the idea. Even crummy old films are pushed on TV stations, and charged for. A similar thing will happen with Netflix, who\u2019ll also license many films in blocks. It\u2019s all a way to keep squeezing the Giglis and John Carters of this world until they finally drip black ink onto the ledger and not red.\nAnother small screen outlet will be up in the air. Movies are also licensed for those smudgy little panes on the back of airplane seats. It\u2019s slightly less obvious than television, I guess, and the films tend to be rather newer. I\u2019ve even seen some films on planes that had never played anywhere else, though even Susan Seidelman\u2019s Gaudi Afternoon creeped out on DVD eventually .\nAirplane movies will tend to have been altered somewhat, though I\u2019ve seen a lot of bare boobs, bloodshed and even plane crashes during my more recent long haul pentuple-bills, so perhaps things are changing.\nHave you seen Mel Brooks\u2019 The Producers ? You should. It\u2019s very funny. Uwe Boll certainly has.\nAustralia has recently agreed to welcome the next Pirates Of The Caribbean movie to its shores. That giant production will roll into town, and spend enough mountains of money that the Antipodean economy should feel some kind of effect, even if it\u2019s only a light nudge. It\u2019s good for the country for the filmmakers to go there, and spend money there.\nAnd the Australian government know it, so they made sure it was going to happen by offering a tax incentive. From their press release:\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nThe federal government has agreed to offer the Walt Disney Studios a $21.6 million incentive to shoot Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales in Australia.\nThat package had been offered to Disney by the previous Labor government to film the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea remake in Oz but that project was shelved after director David Fincher departed.\nAgain, this isn\u2019t money made by the movie after release, but it does help offset the costs and therefor increases the likelihood, or at least the pace, of profitability.\nMovie merchandising started in earnest with Walt Disney and his licensing of Mickey Mouse and, interestingly, The Three Little Pigs. Have you seen the sheer volume of Pigs merchandise they produced?\nThings then stayed rather discreet until the 1970s.\nAnd then Star Wars. And then the wall of figures, dozens upon dozens in the range, taking over the toy shop and the department store. Upstairs in my local Co-Op circa 1980 looked like a kingdom of six-inch freaks this close to actually calling out, \u201cHey, you. Yeah, you. The fat one. Buy me. Buy me. Buuuuuuuuuy meeeeeee.\u201d\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nAction figures have always been a big part of merchandising, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be such a stretch to suggest that the success of the articulated figure as an ancillary money-maker has driven Hollywood\u2019s hellbent determination towards blockbusters and franchise films. Nobody is ever going to sell any Deconstructing Harry or The Squid And The Whale toys, so those depend on a sense of prestige and low scale of risk to convince their financiers.\nDo note that even a no-budget, lo-fi character comedy like Clerks has spawned an action figure line, so culture has certainly embraced the little plastic people and, really, even as I was typing Deconstructing Harry and The Squid And The Whale in the last paragraph, I did think to myself \u2018It\u2019s probably only a matter of time.\u2019 You could probably convince me that somebody is planning a line of Grizzly Man action figures if you tried just a little.\nT-shirts, lunchboxes, calendars and bedspreads are amongst the other, obvious mainstays of merchandising. The shirt is open to a much wider range of tie-ins, though there\u2019s a lot of \u2018homage shirts\u2019 arriving through online marketplaces that aren\u2019t officially licensed at all and while they\u2019re generating revenue for someone, it\u2019s not a film studio or production company. Still, there\u2019s something \u2018cool\u2019 about movie shirts that a lunchbox or duvet cover is never, ever going to compete with.\nMeanwhile, and it\u2019s probably going to remain a one off, at least for the next ten years or so, but Buds and Roses in LA are supplying a tie-in strain of sativa with branding based on Kevin Smith\u2019s new horror film, Tusk .\nNovelisations and video games are a specific kind of merchandise that become new media works in their own right. Not since GoldenEye have I been convinced that a movie-to-game translation was really worth my while but I do still, I think that if somebody really nails an adaptation, and it succeeds as a game as well as just being a tie-in, there\u2019s going to be so much money to be made here that the original film itself could be pushed into the margin.\nNovelisations are so desired that I even see a lot of novels adapted from films that were themselves originally adapted from books. Just the other day I saw that there\u2019s a Boxtrolls novelisation ready to go on the shelves alongside Alan Snow\u2019s original Here Be Monsters. Maybe readers are disappointed when the book isn\u2019t quite the same as the film; it certainly seems to cut the other way.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nTalking of Boxtrolls , it\u2019s bound to have a lovely Art Of book, like Paranorman and Coraline before it. That\u2019s probably my personal favourite kind of movie tie-in of all.\nMarvel Comics are an interesting sidebar here, I think. Their movies have made their brand really quite attractive and well-known, and it surely must have driven a lot of sales of their comics.\nIt\u2019s actually that product placement is used to offset expenditure rather than make money from a film, and sometimes the payment is \u2018in kind\u2019 with marketing for the film being provided instead of cash.\nConsider a well-known car manufacturer, for example, and a race of little linguistically-spiteful blue creatures, three apples high. Instead of the studio making money from the prominent appearance of certain vehicles in their movie, that car manufacturer instead agrees to provide an equivalent amount of marketing in their dealerships and TV commercials.\nEven when money does change hands, it will likely be fed into the ledger before the film opens, even before the costs are tallied, so there\u2019s some argument to be made here that product placement doesn\u2019t make films more profitable, it just makes them less costly.\nWhich might, of course, make them more profitable.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nCast your mind back to Jurassic Park once again. During the making of that film, money was spent on developing the CG technology to render its special, animated dinosaurs. Once this technology existed, its proprietors \u2013 in this case, ILM \u2013 would be able to offer its services for hire elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s more common that CG techniques were developed during work-for-hire on commercials and corporate films, but it\u2019s certainly true that breakthroughs have been made during production on movies, and the fruits of these breakthroughs are then worth money.\nOnce more, this isn\u2019t quite money being made for a studio, but it\u2019s cashflow as a result of a movie existing, and so it counts.\nIf I were ever to get on a theme park ride again in my life, and I won\u2019t, it would take something very special to lure me in. Maybe\nBoth Disney and Universal have their own parks, with plentiful movie tie-ins, and other movies have spawned rides and attractions everywhere from Alton Towers to Six Flags.\nThe Halloween Horror Nights would be a subset of this, with their ridiculous, heart-rate battering spectacles more often than not based (loosely) on some existing horror movie franchise or another.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see a Squid And The Whale roller coaster, by the way.\nMoney springs up around cinema because cineastes will indulge in their passion even when it costs them.\nThat bar upstairs in your local pseudo-art house cinema could argue that some of its money comes from it being a bar in a cinema. This would be particularly true on quiz night, I\u2019d suppose. You can\u2019t have a Movie Quiz without movies.\nAnd then there are magazines like Sight And Sound, Empire, SFX, turning reporting, criticism, PR and advertising into moolah. There are websites and blogs about films \u2013 you might have seen one or two, a couple of them are even worth looking at (not this one, mind) \u2013 that also raise revenue, if they\u2019re lucky. Some of this money then goes to the people who create this content, the lucky ones who get to write about film, who get to call going to a press screening \u2018a job\u2019, who get to pore over old Rambo annuals professionally, who take over the airwaves for a bit of a rant of a Friday afternoon.\nOh, and I\u2019d put Faber & Faber\u2019s books under this heading too, most of them relating to more than any one movie, engaging more with a general interest in the cinematic arts.\nLicensing films to play in the classroom isn\u2019t cheap and can cost well over \u00a3100 per title. The law does allow the playing of excerpts, and nobody can stop a teacher from instructing the class to go home and watch a film on their own time \u2013 it\u2019s the ideal kind of homework \u2013 so I have always found a workaround for my students.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nTalking of my students, here\u2019s an exercise I\u2019ve used to bore them all. I\u2019d cover the whiteboard with a whole scatter of words, \u2018nodes\u2019 of the film industry\u2019s cashflow. I\u2019d write up \u201cCinema\u201d and \u201cDVD shop\u201d, \u201cFilm Studio\u201d and \u201cActors\u201d and a whole bunch more besides. The students are then tasked with drawing in arrows indicating the flow of money between these nodes, illustrating the flow of money in the movie biz.\nSo, if they did it right, they\u2019d get an arrow going from \u2018customer\u2019 to \u2018cinema,\u2019 then another from \u2018cinema\u2019 to \u2018distributor.\u2019 We\u2019d end up with a good dozen arrows, snaking around all over the board.\nThere were two \u2018nodes\u2019 on that board of particular interest. One would be \u2018customer,\u2019 which had arrows coming out but none going in. The opposite would be \u2018pirates\u2019 with arrows going in, but none coming out.\nSomebody is making money off of that \u00a31 bootleg sold off a blanket down by the football stadium, and somebody is making money off of the ads on the torrent site. It\u2019s not anybody who deserves to make the money, of course, and this money is going somewhere altogether different than your cinema ticket, but piracy does make money. For someone. It was easier to track pre-internet, when the IRA funded their operations by running VHS copiers, but I promise you, there\u2019s money in piracy.\nAnd no, that\u2019s not career advice.\nNow, I\u2019d have been happier with show art or show entertainment, though probably not show exhibitionist impulse. Show business is what we have, though, and it can work. Money might make the wheels turn round, but it\u2019s not always in control of the handlebars.\nAd \u2013 content continues below\nIf it couldn\u2019t work sometimes, then there wouldn\u2019t be any films worth loving, this website wouldn\u2019t exist, and I would have had to spend the last six hours doing a proper job instead.\nShow business isn\u2019t so bad, I suppose. It certainly puts a lot of bread onto a lot of tables, and that alone is a very good thing indeed.\nYou can follow Brendon on Twitter ."], "citation_links": ["https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16-different-ways-that-films-make-money/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_f6d3a8fd-4290-423c-8f97-2926a661fb7b"}

{"question": "How did American high schools end up being very sports-oriented?", "claim": "Over time, high school sports became more organized and competitive, with some schools becoming known for producing professional athletes.", "claim_raw_string": "Over time, high school sports became more organized and competitive, with some schools becoming known for producing professional athletes.", "response": "High school sports in America have their origins in student organizations from the 1880s. They began as casual ball games played by students, and were motivated in part by intercollegiate sports.

American culture's emphasis on sports as a point of community pride and \"oneness\" has also contributed to the popularity of high school sports.", "references": ["Tony Dejak/Associated Press\nWhether it\u2019s the result of location, coaching, luck, all of the above or something else entirely, certain high schools simply have a knack for producing professional athletes.\nSchools such as St. Thomas Aquinas, Long Beach Polytechnic and DeMatha Catholic have halls and, with extraordinary consistency, some of world\u2019s finest athletes have graced them. Athletes like Michael Irvin (St. Thomas Aquinas), Tony Gwynn (Long Beach Poly) and Adrian Dantley (DeMatha) laid a path to the pros for others to follow\u2026and oh so many did just that.\nThough sometimes overlooked, high schools develop the athletes that feed the pros. Of course, some do it better than others and on a more consistent basis. So, with this in mind, we\u2019ve decided to feature the very best, ranking the Top 10 Powerhouse High Schools That Keep Making Pros.\nBefore we get started, though, let\u2019s review the ranking formula. For starters, specialist schools\u2014like Glades Central in football and Oak Hill in basketball, to name a couple\u2014did not qualify. This list celebrates the schools that, over the years, produced a large number of professional athletes in a wide range of sports.\nFrom there, we considered each school\u2019s total number of pros first and foremost, and then the success and relevance of those pros. In other words, the bigger the name the better, and though the past was considered, the present was valued more.\nWith that out of the way, then, let\u2019s begin our tour of America\u2019s most athletic high schools.\n1 of 11\nSue Ogrocki/Associated Press\nBecause rules prevented an impressive group of \u201cspecialist\u201d schools from making our list, we\u2019ve gone out of our way to honor many of them here. We\u2019ve also included some schools that met all our requirements, but still missed the cut. Either way, these honorable mention nominees claim their fair share of professional talent:\n2 of 11\nDavid Richard/Associated Press\nWe begin our list in Cleveland, Ohio with a small Catholic school that produces pro athletes like chickens produce eggs.\nTwo traditional sports\u2014football and baseball\u2014get a majority of the attention at St. Ignatius, and deservedly so. Brian Dowling\u2014a former QB and Heisman finalist while starring at Yale\u2014kicked things off in 1969, when he joined the NFL \u2019s Minnesota Vikings .\nOliver Luck continued the pro tradition when he was drafted in 1982, and he also gets credit here for giving the world one Andrew Luck . On the diamond, Mike Buddie paved the way for future Wildcats, joining the Yankees in 1998.\nOf course, St. Ignatius wouldn\u2019t have made this list if it hadn\u2019t produced some bigger, more relevant pros. In the \u201890s, future NFL mainstays LeCharles Bentley and Chris Hovan could be seen walking the halls of St. Ignatius, and Cleveland Browns QB Brian Hoyer\u2014with the help of WR Anthony Gonzalez and OL Jacob Bell\u2014carries the torch today.\nThe high school also lays claim to numerous active MLBers, including Derek Dietrich (Miami Marlins) and Matt Kata (Texas Rangers).\nOn our list, diversity counts, too, and Ignatius qualifies here easily. In 1990, Timothy Mack was a Wildcat. In 2004, Mack pole-vaulted his way to an Olympic gold medal.\nThe school has also been kind to the MLS, sending both Justin Morrow (San Jose Earthquakes) and Barry Rice (DC United) the league\u2019s way.\n3 of 11\nJohn Locher/Associated Press\nThis Chicago pro-sport factory hasn\u2019t been quite as prolific as some of the other schools on our list. It has, however, produced pros in multiple sports and is seriously distinguished in the \u201cbang-for-the-buck\u201d department.\nAs most know, Simeon\u2019s true claim to fame rests on the hardwood, where notable NBAer Nick Anderson made a name for himself and the school in the middle of the \u201880s.\nThe rock hardly stopped there, though, as both Derrick Rose of the Chicago Bulls and Jabari Parker of the Milwaukee Bucks rep the school today. It\u2019s worth noting, this list would be longer and more impressive if not for Ben Wilson\u2019s tragic death in November of 1984.\nAs for the school\u2019s \u201csecondary\u201d athletes, outfielder Wes Chamberlain made it pro in 1990 when he signed a contract with the Philadelphia Phillies and, along the gridiron, safety Martez Wilson continues inflicting pain today, now on behalf of the New Orleans Saints .\n4 of 11\nWALLY SANTANA/Associated Press\nKnown to most simply as Dorsey , this historic school sits in the heart of Los Angeles and has turned \u201cJoes\u201d to pros one generation after another.\nThe school was a virtual baseball factory in the early 1950s, producing long-time pros like Billy Consolo and Ed Palmquist, in addition to Hall of Famer George \u201cSparky\u201d Anderson.\nDorsey\u2019s tradition of excellence on the diamond has hardly dissipated, either, with former Dons like Chili Davis (former player, current Oakland Athletics coach) and Derrel Thomas (LA Dodgers) still collecting checks today.\nWith all that said, football is clearly Dorsey\u2019s bread and butter. Over the years, it has sent countless students to the pro ranks, including stars such as Hue Jackson, Butch Johnson, Na\u2019il Diggs, Rahim Moore, Dennis Northcutt and former No. 1 overall draft pick Keyshawn Johnson.\nFinally, with the school\u2019s well-rounded athletics in mind, we should mention James Wilkes, who spent three seasons (1980-82) with the Chicago Bulls.\n5 of 11\nStew Milne/Associated Press\nThis California high school checks all the boxes.\nIt has produced close to 20 professional athletes across three different sports\u2014football, basketball and baseball\u2014and has remained relevant with numerous alumni still getting it done, including Green Bay Packer offensive tackle David Bakhtiari.\nWhat sets Serra apart, however, are the legendary superstars for which it is responsible. That list includes the likes of NFL Hall of Famer Lynn Swann, home-run king Barry Bonds and three-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady .\nThe remaining schools on our list outrank Serra in quantity, but no school in America is responsible for better quality.\nForget high schools for a moment. How many colleges can claim they\u2019ve produced this decade\u2019s best baseball player and its best quarterback, in addition to one of the greatest wide receivers in football history? Not many.\nAnd to think we still have six more schools to go\u2026\n6 of 11\nJim Mone/Associated Press\nTo call Northwestern anything other than a football power would be misleading.\nIt\u2019s alumni list of current and former NFLers is downright disgusting: Brett Perriman, Marvin Jones, Nate Webster, Marvin \u201cSnoop\u201d Minnis, Antonio Bryant, Vernon Carey, Torrie Cox, Lavonte David, Sean Spence, Marcus Forston, Trevor Ford and Teddy Bridgewater, to name just a few.\nOh, and in approximately eight months, Alabama star wideout Amari Cooper will unquestionably join this prestigious list.\nOf course, we\u2019re honoring athletic programs that are as versatile as they are prolific, rather than more focused specialists.\nAs a result, we must acknowledge former Bull Stan McKenzie, who played pro basketball from 1966-1973, and Tim James, who spent three years in the NBA (1999-2001) and another couple playing abroad.\nWe\u2019d also be remiss if we left out Olympian Tiffany Ross-Williams. The former Northwestern star has an impressive pro resume, which includes national championships in the 400-meter hurdle in both 2007 and 2008.\n7 of 11\nAssociated Press\nThough some of the schools we\u2019ve already mentioned may have more overall star power, this California private schoo l is responsible for more than 20 professional athletes in an astonishing six different sports\u2014football, basketball, baseball, soccer (Robbie Rogers), wrestling (Tiki Ghosn) and pole vault (Greg Woepse).\nJohn Huarte dominated opponents on the Mater Dei gridiron in the late \u201850s and early \u201860s and eventually won a Heisman Trophy at Notre Dame before enjoying a 10-year pro career.\nToday, guys like Matt Barkley (Philadelphia Eagles), Colt Brennan (drafted by Washington , current free agent), Khaled Holmes ( Indianapolis Colts ) and Matt Leinart (drafted by Arizona , current free agent) make Monarchs everywhere proud.\nMater Dei sports an impressive list of baseball pros as well. Sergio Santos saves games for the Toronto Blue Jays while Danny Espinosa holds down second for the Washington Nationals.\nOn the hardwood, numerous current and former pros once attended Mater Dei, including LeRon Ellis, Jamal Sampson, Miles Simon, DJ Strawberry and both Travis and David Wear.\nWe should also acknowledge Stanley Johnson\u2014one of 2014\u2019s top recruits\u2014who currently suits up for the Arizona Wildcats, but will more than likely call the NBA home sooner than later.\n8 of 11\nMichael Conroy/Associated Press\nMore than any of the schools previously mentioned, California\u2019s De La Salle is responsible for producing stars of both yesterday and today across numerous professional leagues.\nIn football, offensive guard Aaron Taylor gained notoriety in 1994 when the Green Bay Packers selected him in the first round of the NFL draft.\nOf course, De La Salle\u2019s gridiron tradition hardly ended then, with alumni such as Amani Toomer (former Giant), TJ Ward ( Denver ), Maurice Jones-Drew (Oakland) and DJ Williams (Chicago) managing to star on Sundays, too.\nFormer Spartans have also found tremendous success on the hardwood, including legends like Jon and Brent Barry.\nIn soccer as well, De La Salle helped numerous athletes realize their professional dreams, and that list includes Seattle Sounders goalie Stefan Frei and US National team forward Chris Wondolowski.\nThe school also contributed to the success achieved by Chicago Cubs catcher John David Baker and American diver Kristian Ipsen, who won a bronze medal in the 2012 Olympic Games.\n9 of 11\nJohn Raoux/Associated Press\nLike De La Salle, Dematha high school of Hyattsville, Maryland, has a long-standing tradition of athletic excellence, producing a large number of stars in numerous sports and throughout multiple generations.\nIn basketball alone, 15 current or former pros cut their teeth on DeMatha\u2019s courts.\nAs you\u2019d imagine, the list is an impressive one, beginning most notably in the '70s with Kenny Carr and Adrian Dantley. Guys like Sidney Lowe (1983-90) and Danny Ferry (1989-2003) continued the school\u2019s illustrious tradition, while Keith Bogans (Boston) and Orlando\u2019s Victor Oladipo\u2014the No. 2 overall pick in 2013\u2014ensure its basketball relevance today.\nDeMatha\u2019s comparable success on the gridiron is as impressive as it is unique. Linebacker Mike Johnson was a Stag in the late \u201870s and a Pro Bowler by 1989.\nHe was followed by standouts such as running back Brian Westbrook (2002-10), defensive end Cameron Wake (2007-present) and offensive tackle Cyrus Kouandjio (drafted 44th overall in 2014).\nIts athletic success is hardly confined to the two aforementioned sports, however. Derek Mills won a gold medal in track and field at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Jordan Graye (Carolina RailHawks) and Drew Yates (Charlotte Eagles) currently play soccer professionally, and Paul Rabil (Philadelphia Wings) competes on the professional lacrosse circuit (the MLL).\nOh, and we better not forget Coy Gibbs, who once drove cars fast for a living before serving as an assistant coach with the Washington Redskins. You may know Gibbs better for his current line of work: He now owns Joe Gibbs Racing Motocross.\n10 of 11\nMatt Slocum/Associated Press\nLike each of the schools previously mentioned, Long Beach Poly \u2014located in Long Beach, California\u2014schooled a hoard of future pros.\nNone of those institutions, however, match Poly\u2019s absurd numbers and diverse production. In all, more than 50 Jackrabbits\u2014in 11 different sports\u2014realized their professional dreams.\nFrom professional racing to skateboarding, water polo and hockey, Poly grads reached the pinnacle in a wide range of sports.\nThe powerhouse high school is not without more traditional stars, either.\nTennis great Billie Jean King walked the Poly halls.\nIn baseball, stars like Milton Bradley, Tony Gwynn and Chase Utley once donned Poly\u2019s green and gold.\nOn the hardwood, Tyus Edney and Morlon Wiley played with Jackrabbit pride.\nAnd on the football field, elite talents like Willie McGinest, Manuel Wright, Winston Justice, Marcedes Lewis and DeSean Jackson cemented Poly excellence.\nSome of the lower-ranked schools may have slightly more star power, but none combine that strength with Cal Poly\u2019s sheer numbers or unique diversity.\n11 of 11\nTony Dejak/Associated Press\nWe end our tour of elite high schools with Fort Lauderdale\u2019s St. Thomas Aquinas, a school that has given to the pro sports world in just about every way imaginable.\nFoluke Akinradewo is a professional volleyball player and was a member of the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Sanya Richard-Ross took part in the very same Olympics and won gold in the Women\u2019s 400-meter race.\nBoth are former Raiders. You can also add professional swimmers, divers and discuss throwers to the lengthy list of distinguished Aquinas athletes.\nOf course, Aquinas excels in the slightly more traditional sports, too.\nIn soccer, Eric Eichmann kicked things off for the Raiders and eventually made it to a World Cup, suiting up for the 1990 U.S. Men\u2019s National Team. Eichmann, though, merely set the stage, as bigger names such as India Trotter and Alejandro Bedoya built on his legacy. Bedoya, in particular, is a familiar name to soccer fans after appearing for the U.S. in all four of its 2014 World Cup matches.\nNot to be confined, Aquinas excels in tennis and golf as well, producing world champions in both. Over the years, three Raider tennis stars reached pro status, though Hall of Famer Chris Evert is clearly the most renowned of the group. And, on the links, 2013 PGA Champion Jason Dufner only strengthens the Aquinas reputation for excellence.\nAs one would imagine, the Raiders play some solid baseball, too. Former Raider Mike Stanley was a 1995 American League All-Star, while Tyler Greene currently suits up for the San Diego Padres.\nWhat pushes Aquinas over the top, however, is its prowess on the gridiron. Household names like Brian Piccolo and Michael Irvin exemplify the school's impressive history and tradition. Meanwhile, its current crop of NFLers is about as impressive as it gets.\nGuys like Major Wright, Lamarcus Joyner, Leonard Hankerson and Marcus Gilbert play meaningful roles on rosters today, while Geno Atkins and Giovani Bernard represent two of the very best the NFL has to offer.\nIn a group of giants, Aquinas stands the tallest\u2014with the history, numbers, prestige and relevance to stake its claim as the most athletic high school in all of America.\nB/R Recommends"], "citation_links": ["https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2214348-power-house-high-schools-that-keep-making-pros"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_c75cd223-f168-48e0-887e-d67ddbbf58a8"}

Over time, high school sports became more organized and competitive, with some schools becoming known for producing professional athletes. American culture's emphasis on sports as a point of community pride and \"oneness\" has also contributed to the popularity of high school sports.", "references": ["OVERVIEW\nRobert M. Malina\nROLE IN STUDENT'S SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT\nSharon Shields\nElizabeth Gilbert\nSchool sports refer to athletic programs in the context of the school setting. They refer most often to interschool competition at the middle/junior high school and high school levels in the United States. Interschool programs at the elementary level vary among communities. School sports also include intramural competition, but such programs are very rare. In the mid-1990s, intramural sports involved only about 450,000 middle, junior, and senior high school students, or 3 percent of the high school\u2013aged population.\nThe objective of school sports is the enrichment of the high school experiences of students within the context of the educational mission of schools. As such, school sports should be educational and contribute to the overall education of all students, not athletes only. Other objectives of school sports logically follow from the educational mission: citizenship, sportsmanship, fair play, teamwork, respect, and health and welfare of all students not only during the school years but continuing into adulthood.\nTwo major forces were involved in the development of interscholastic sports in the United States: the school program, specifically physical education, and students. The initial focus was almost exclusively on boys. Within the school program, Luther Gulick established the New York Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) in 1903, and similar leagues were organized in 177 cities by 1915. The purpose was to encourage a healthy, strong body and mind through competitive exercises. The PSAL initially conducted \"class athletics\" in grades five through eight at specific times each year, not interschool competition as it is known today. Class athletics included seasonal track and field events (fall, standing long jump; winter, chinning the bar; spring, running sprints). PSALs also emphasized swimming, popular sports of the times (baseball, football, basketball), and several minor games.\nInterscholastic high school sports for boys had their origins in student organizations in the 1880s. They were motivated in part by intercollegiate sports, especially football, baseball, and track and field. Activities of sports clubs attracted the attention of administrators and faculty, who had major reservations about the time and energy devoted to sports and effects on the schools, including the small number of boys involved, quality of coaching (clubs often hired their own coaches), unsportsmanlike conduct, use of \"ringers\" (nonstudents, professionals), outof-town travel, length of schedule, interference with school work, lack of carry-over value, injury (especially in football), and emphasis on winning, among others. Although the welfare of high school athletes was a major issue, more important, perhaps, was concern of faculty and administrators for the reputations of the schools and the perceived need for adult control. These factors contributed to the formation of state high school athletic associations, such as those in Michigan (started in 1895) and Indiana (1903). State associations in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin formed the Midwest Federation of State High School Athletic Associations in 1921, which became the National Federation of State High School Athletic Associations in 1923. The name was subsequently changed to the National Federation of State High School Associations in the 1970s when the fine arts were established as a program area.\nTwo important factors in the acceptance, or perhaps tolerance, of interscholastic sports by administrators and faculty were the scholastic performance of boys and school retention. Boys did not do as well as girls in school, dropped out more often than girls did, and were commonly behind in grade level. Between 1890 and 1920, the majority of public school students (56%\u201358%) and graduates (61%\u201365%) were girls. Child labor and compulsory schooling laws, which were passed early in the twentieth century, contributed to increased school attendance.\nA related factor was the emergence of progressive education and how it addressed the needs and problems of boys in a coeducational setting. The percentage of women teachers in high schools increased (65% in 1920), and an important role was attributed to interscholastic sports in meeting the needs of boys in this context. Educators \"sought to instill a more masculine tone and temper in the schools, in part by co-opting the informal interscholastic athletics that the boys themselves had created\" (Tyack and Hansot, p. 166).\nInterscholastic sports spread rapidly from the 1930s through the 1950s, at a time when the medical and physical education communities were opposed to competitive sports for elementary and junior high, and occasionally high school, students. Sport opportunities for females also increased, but school sports were largely the domain of males. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which was implemented in 1975, increased sport opportunities for girls.\nThe estimated number of participants in high school sports from 1971 to 2000 is illustrated in Figure 1. While the number of students enrolled in high school declined from the late 1970s to 1990, the number of athletes was rather stable after a slight decrease, 3.3 to 3.5 million males and 1.7 to 1.9 million females. Since 1990, numbers of high school students and athletes increased, but the increase in athletes was somewhat less in males (3.4 to 3.9 million) than in females (1.9 to 2.7 million). The larger increase in females reflected implementation of Title IX legislation and increased interest in sports for girls.\nAs a percentage of total students in grades nine through twelve, the number of male athletes was, with few exceptions, rather stable between 24 percent and 26 percent from 1971 to 2000 (see Figure2). The percentage of female athletes increased from 2 percent in 1971 to 10 percent in 1975 and then more gradually from 12 percent in 1978 to 18 percent in 1999\u20132000. As a percentage of male athletes, the number of female athletes increased from 8 percent in 1971 to 53 percent in 1980 and then more gradually to 69 percent in 1999\u20132000.\nReported participation in high school sports in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is consistent with trends in Figure 2. Weighted percentages of youth reporting participation in high school sports only in 1997 were 24.0 percent for males and 23.9 percent for females (see Table 1). Relatively more white males and females reported participating in school sports only than Hispanic and black males and females, and relatively more Hispanic students reported participating in school sports than black students. The YRBS also included nonschool sports. More males than females reported participation in both school and nonschool sports and the ethnic difference between black and white males was reversed. Participation in both school and nonschool sports is an issue among state high school associations, largely in terms of the time demands on youth as well as increasing demands and pressures from nonschool sport organizations for year-round participation in a single sport.\nCorresponding estimates for other countries are not available. Intramural and to a lesser extent interschool sports competition are offered in some countries, but highly developed interscholastic sports programs as in the United States are not available. Most sports are organized in the context of specific clubs independent of the schools.\nThe ten most popular sports for boys and girls based on numbers of schools offering the sports in 1999\u20132000 are summarized in Table 2. Data for 1989\u20131990 are included for comparison. The most popular sport offerings have changed little. Competitive spirit squads replaced indoor track and field for girls. Soccer showed the largest gains over ten years, 99 percent in girls and 42 percent in boys. The same pattern was apparent for golf, 75 percent in girls and 26 percent in boys. With the exception of football\nFIGURE 1\n(down 5%), all sports showed an increase in offerings over ten years.\nCorresponding statistics for the ten most popular sports for boys and girls based on numbers of participants are summarized in Table 3. Football had the largest number of participants among boys, followed by basketball. Over the ten year interval, the number of participants in the top ten sports for boys increased and several sports changed rank. Baseball and wrestling declined, while track and field and soccer gained. The number of boys participating in soccer increased by about 50 percent in ten years. Other sports for boys that showed significant gains were golf (35%), outdoor track and field (18%) and cross country (17%).\nAmong girls, the number of participants in competitive spirit squads replaced golf in the top ten. The ranking of the top four sports (basketball, track and field, volleyball, and softball) did not change, while soccer moved to fifth. The number of participants in soccer increased by 142 percent, followed by fast pitch softball (67%), swimming and diving (63%), and cross country (47%). Overall and within the same or similar sports, relative increases in female participants were greater than corresponding increases in males.\nFIGURE 2\nAlthough interscholastic sport program are popular, they are not without problems. Some are inherent to sports (such as injuries), whereas others span a range of issues.\nSafety and injuries. Concern for the health and welfare of high school athletes is a primary objective of interscholastic programs. Nevertheless, risk of injury is inherent to sports. Comparison of injury rates for five sports in males (baseball, basketball, football, soccer, wrestling) and five sports in females (basketball, field hockey, soccer, softball, volleyball) during the 1995\u20131997 school years indicated the following trends (see Table 4). Football had the highest and baseball the lowest injury rates among the five sports for boys, whereas soccer had the highest and volleyball the lowest rates of injuries among the five sports for girls. Except for volleyball, injury rates were higher during games than practices in both genders. Sprains and strains, general trauma (including contusions), and fractures accounted for most of the injuries. About 90 percent of all reported injuries were new.\nEstimated injury rates (per 100 athletes) in similar or the same sports were higher in girls than in boys for softball/baseball and soccer, but virtually identical for basketball. Rates of knee injuries were higher in female basketball and soccer players compared to male athletes in these sports, but only slightly more common in softball than in baseball players. Knee injuries required surgery more often in females than in males, and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery was especially more common in female basketball and soccer players than in male participants in these sports. The higher incidence of ACL injuries in adolescent and adult female athletes is well documented, and the issue of predisposing factors is an area of current study.\nAmong inherent risks in sport is the risk of death. Although deaths in sport are rare at young ages, they receive considerable media attention. Estimated rates for nontraumatic sport deaths in high school and college athletes thirteen to twenty-three years of age are less than one per 100,000 participants per year, but the ratio of males to females is about ten to one. Rates are higher among college than high school male athletes. Nontraumatic deaths in sport are due primarily to cardiovascular causes, but several noncardiovascular causes are also involved, including hyperthermia, electrocution due to lightning, and complications of asthma. These are preventable conditions. Corresponding data for traumatic deaths in high school athletes are less than one per 100,000 participants.\nCarry-over. Benefits of participation in interscholastic sports should presumably carry over to other aspects of life during adolescence. Data from the YRBS indicate associations between sports participation and positive health behaviors related to physical activity, diet, cigarette smoking, illegal drug use, and reduced sexual intercourse (females). Associations were strongest for white and less consistent for black and Hispanic high school students. Other data indicate positive associations between sports participation and educational (higher grades, lower drop-out rates) and social (leadership roles, self-assurance) behaviors. Data relating high school sports participation to adult behaviors are generally lacking. Consequences of sport injuries for health in adulthood also need study.\nCoaches and coach education. Qualifications for coaches vary among states and school districts. Many states and districts require coaches to have a teaching certificate, but there apparently is a lack of teachers with either an interest in coaching or the necessary credentials. As a result, an increasing number of coaches are not teachers and do not have faculty status. Nonteacher coaches are commonly required to complete a coach education program that includes principles of growth and development, coaching (theory, methods, psychology), and training (conditioning, nutrition); injury prevention, management and care; CPR and sports first aid; and risk management. Available courses vary in depth of content and mode of delivery. Coach education is required for nonteachers in 35 states and the District of Columbia and for all coaches in 15 states, but is not required in 15 states.\nThere is a lack of uniform standards for coaches education, although a comprehensive set has been recommended by the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. Professional coach education programs analogous to the systematic preparation and certification of teachers are not available in the United States.\nProgrammatic issues. School sport programs are currently affected by a number of issues, including schools that focus on a single sport (\"rogue schools,\" \"factories\"); emphasis on \"nationally ranked programs,\" which implies national travel during the school year; recruiting, especially for summer basketball; increasing numbers of international students; and threats to amateurism. International students are often concentrated in rogue schools for basketball and reported ages are commonly questioned. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) has already foregone the rules of amateurism, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) may be moving in this direction.\nHigh school programs generally emphasize competition and program success rather than developing skills for the next level of athletic competition. In contrast, many national sport governing bodies emphasize talent identification, development, and medals, and prefer that talented youth be passed along to a higher level of coaching and training than at the high school level. Talent identification programs in many sports are not consistent with objectives of school sports.\nCollege scholarships. Unrealistic expectations for sport success beyond high school plague many programs and college scholarships are a major issue. The probability of receiving a college athletic scholarship is small. Of approximately three million\nTABLE 1\neighth graders in 1988, only about 5 percent later reported participation in intercollegiate sports and only about 2 percent were in Division I schools. The number was further reduced when only those who received athletic financial aid was considered. Only 48 percent of all NCAA Division I athletes received athletic aid (scholarships) in 1992\u20131993.\nThe lure of college scholarships, especially for basketball and football, has resulted in widespread scouting at the middle or junior high school levels and commercially sponsored prep school football combines analogous to the National Football League. In the context of competition with professional leagues, the NCAA is also discussing a mentoring program for elite athletes as young as 12 years, specifically for basketball. One can question whose interests are best being served by such programs and their consistency with educational objectives of high school sports. Probability of success in sport beyond college is even more remote.\nViolence. Violence at sporting events involving participants, coaches, and spectators is increasingly reported. The violence reflects interactions among several factors, including overemphasis on winning, lack of administrative supervision, lack of respect for authority, inconsistent officiating, social inequities in schools, and perhaps parental and community overinvolvement. Violence is also routinely tolerated and sanctioned in several highly popular sports, specifically ice hockey and football, and occasionally basketball and soccer (e.g., \"professional fouls\"). Respect\nTABLE 2\nfor opponents and sport and sportsmanship need stronger emphasis if the educational objectives of sport are to be attained.\nSport was allegedly a focus of attention in the violence that occurred in Littleton, Colorado, in the spring of 1999. The perpetrators of the violence allegedly identified athletes as targets and were described as being on the fringe of the high school social circles. These events raise important issues related to the preferential position and treatment of varsity athletes and the marginalization of some students by the social structure of high schools. Varsity sport is exclusive and schools offer few, if any, opportunities for youth who are not sufficiently skilled or who lack the size required for some sports. Schools and communities often indulge in varsity athletes in major sports and rank them among the socially elite. Administrators and coaches often tolerate unacceptable behaviors of athletes (physical, verbal, and social bullying; criminal activities), giving athletes a different status compared to other students. \"Trash talk\" and the \"in-your-face\" demeanor of many sports, which are essentially forms of non-physical violence, are commonly treated by coaches, administrators, and commentators as a form of strategy or \"sport smarts.\" Does such verbal abuse contribute to poor sportsmanship, lack of respect for opponents and the sport, and physical violence? The data are suggestive.\nNonschool sports. Programs for talented young athletes (and by extension some coaches) to participate in a sport after the school season, but during the school year and in the summer, have expanded recently. High school eligibility can be compromised and young athletes face the risk of overtraining, injury, and exploitation. Some programs also compete directly with school sports. This is perhaps most apparent in elite youth soccer clubs that call for year-round training in the sport following the professional model.

M ALINA\nTABLE 4\nThe role of sport in society, and more particularly in schools, has been debated for many decades. There are divergent viewpoints on the value of sport, with proponents on one end of the continuum hailing sport as having the same goals and objectives as all of education and on the other end those who purport that sport is an entertainment enterprise that should be separated from education altogether.\nThe development of organized sports and games in the United States has had an interesting history. Early settlers in the United States brought some games with them, but there was a minimal amount of organized athletics in communities and none in the schools until near the middle of the nineteenth century. Very little is known about the early history of sport development, but most authorities agree on the historical evolution of the major American sports that were developed in the eighteenth century. The first organized baseball team was founded in 1845, and the first college game was played between Amherst and Williams in 1859. The game of American football originated from soccer and rugby; the first game is claimed to have occurred in 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton. James Naismith created the game of basketball in 1891 to fill a need for play and sport during long winter months. Sports received mixed reviews, as the activities were usually conducted by citizens on a volunteer basis or by unsupervised high school and university students. By 1879 a need arose for systemization of sport and for a governing agent to oversee sports in the United States, which resulted in the formation of the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888. In 1906 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was founded as an outgrowth of meetings held by twenty-eight of the nation's colleges.\nThe NCAA and AAU have remained powerful governance boards in regulating college and all other amateur sports in America. As girls and women entered the sport arena, the formation of the National Association of Girls and Women in Sport in 1899 was instrumental in providing sound sport opportunities for all girls and women in a variety of sports at the elementary, high school, and collegiate levels. In 1971, with the impending passage of Title IX, representatives from 278 colleges and universities formed the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), which governed women's intercollegiate sports until a takeover by the NCAA in 1981. The AIAW began to level the playing field for girls and women in sport. For the first time in American history, women's sports began to rival men's programs in the number of contests held, which increased the amount of publicity given to women's sports. When the NCAA took over as the governing body of women's intercollegiate athletics, it inherited a new era in women's participation. In 1971, only 31,000 women were engaged in varsity sports; a decade later there were 70,000, and the numbers have continued to escalate significantly.\nIn the United States, participation in organized sports has become a common rite of childhood. At the beginning of the twentieth century, agencies and schools provided sport opportunities as a means of providing wholesome leisure time activities for children and youth. Prior to 1954, most of these experiences occurred in Boys and Girls Clubs, Young Men's Christian Associations (YMCA), Young Women's Christian Associations (YWCA), Boy Scouts, and Girl Scouts. With the inception of Little League Baseball in 1954, sport for youth moved from social agencies and activities organized by youth themselves to adult-organized sport programs. In the early twenty-first century, schools have organized teams primarily for the \"athletically elite,\" often to the exclusion of the majority of students. Opportunities for youth to engage in sport remain unequal across genders and social class.\nThe debate continues as to the value of sport in education. Sport is ingrained in society as both an educational fixture and an entertainment enterprise. The argument continues as to whether or not sport holds valued benefits for its youth and young adult participants and therefore warrants a prominent place in the educational system.\nA wide spectrum of outcomes has been attributed to modern-day sports and play. Critics have condemned sport for fostering excessive violence, an overemphasis on competition and winning, and the exploitation of individuals. Sport proponents have extolled the value of sport as a contributor to health, personal fulfillment, and community integration.\nIt is important to look at how sport has the potential for producing positive outcomes in educational and noneducational settings for children and youth. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has proposed a model for systematically assessing the potential positive outcomes of sports and the conditions necessary to produce them. The Csikszentmihalyi model is based on the premise that four main types of consequences are of importance when examining and/or evaluating any sport activity. Two of these consequences are present at the individual level: personal enjoyment and personal growth; and two are at the community level: social harmony/integration and social growth/change. In relation to this model, an ideal sport activity is one that contributes in significant ways to all four types of outcomes.\nLeonard Wankel and Philip Kreisel have identified five factors that should be present for a child or youth to experience the benefit of personal enjoyment in sport: personal accomplishment, excitement of the sport, improving one's sports skills, testing one's skills against others, and just performing the skills. These factors are thought to contribute most to the enjoyment of sport.\nPersonal growth includes a variety of physical and psychological factors. Physical health can be maintained and improved through sport participation by enhancing the cardiovascular system; improving blood pressure and cholesterol levels; increasing muscular strength; improving muscular endurance, flexibility, and bone density; and weight management. Because sports are a major type of activity in which children and youth are involved, it is considered a viable method of promoting good health. Lifetime sports, such as golf, tennis, swimming, and cycling, are especially beneficial in meeting nationally established health objectives. Early childhood participation in sport can minimize the emphasis on competition and focus on skill instruction. However, sports may not be a sufficient substitute for physical education programs in the schools. Quality physical education curriculums that have developmentally appropriate physical activities which provide the necessary foundations in motor skill, movement acquisition, and behavioral development can enable children and youth to become successful participants in organized sport.\nNumerous studies support the positive relationship that exists between psychological well-being and regular involvement in physical activity, especially in the areas of reduction of anxiety and depression. Conditions to maximize such outcomes are usually associated with individual preferences related to activity type; environmental factors; level of competition or intensity of activity; and individual versus group format.\nSport has also been shown to serve as a mechanism for the transmission of values, knowledge, and norms in creating social harmony. The specific values conveyed may be those of the dominant society, or they could be those of a subgroup. Therefore, sport could contribute to either differentiation and stratification or to integration into the overall society. Evidence indicates that different sports appeal to different social stratifications in the society and may reinforce cultural or societal differences. Sport also may serve to transmit general societal values, which leads many sport authorities to believe that sport has positive value for the participants in building character, discipline, a strong work ethic, and the ability to work in teams. The research literature supports the importance of de-emphasizing winning and competition and thereby moving young people into positive and enjoyable experiences. Unfortunately, the trend has been toward a more competitive, \"win-oriented\" framework, which has created increased aggression and violent behaviors among spectators and youth participants. This has led to many national forums at the high school, collegiate, and community levels to reassess the sport culture.\nPositive outcomes related to socialization and social integration are also dependent upon appropriate leadership, as well as the creation of a climate for this to occur within the sport experience. Changes within sport and change in the general society have a symbiotic relationship\u2013general societal changes affect sport, and changes in sport can also affect society.\nYouth sports participation can have many benefits for the individual and for society. However, it is evident that sports can produce negative consequences if quality programs are not developed. Schools and communities can strive for the highest standards by educating and training coaches, deterring the professionalization of youth sports programs, and abiding by the guidelines established by national sport governing bodies, so that sports programs have optimal benefit for all youth, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, or ability.\nC SIKSZENTMIHALYI , M IHALY. 1982. \"The Value of Sports.\" In Sport in Perspective, ed.

The film series started with a trilogy set in medias res that was later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies, known as the \" Skywalker Saga \".\nThe 1977 self-titled film , later subtitled Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope , was followed by the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), respectively subtitled onscreen as Episode V and Episode VI ; these films form the original trilogy . Sixteen years later, the prequel trilogy was released, consisting of Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005). After creator George Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to Disney in 2012, a sequel trilogy consisting of Episodes VII through IX was released, consisting of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe first three spin-off films produced were the made-for-television Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), The Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985). Following Disney's 2012 acquisition of the franchise, these earlier films were dropped from the official canon , but the theatrical animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and its television series continuation retain their canonical status. Two standalone films were produced and released between the sequel trilogy films: Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), both set between the original and prequel trilogies. Untitled movies from Taika Waititi , James Mangold , Dave Filoni , and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy have been officially announced as being written, while other unspecified films are reportedly in early stages of development. [a]\nThe combined box office revenue of the films amounts to over ten billion dollars, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise . The major live-action releases (including all the films within the Skywalker Saga) were nominated for Academy Awards . The original film was nominated for most of the major categories, including Best Picture , Best Director , Best Original Screenplay , and Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness (who played Obi-Wan Kenobi ), while all theatrical live-action films have been nominated for particular categories. Several official Star Wars television series have also been released, all now on Disney+ .\nThe main Star Wars film series is a trilogy of trilogies; as it neared completion, Disney began to refer to it as the \"Skywalker Saga\". [1] [2] It was released beginning with the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI , 1977\u20131983), followed by the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III , 1999\u20132005) and the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII and IX , 2015\u20132019). [b] The first film released, Star Wars (1977), is the fourth film chronologically and was later subtitled Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope . The saga begins chronologically with Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) and concludes with Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe story follows each generation of the Force -sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith Lord Darth Sidious (Palpatine) . The prequel trilogy focuses on Anakin Skywalker , his training as a Jedi , and his eventual fall to the dark side as Darth Vader due to Palpatine's machinations and his fear of losing his wife Padm\u00e9 Amidala . The original trilogy follows their children, Luke and Leia , as they join the Rebel Alliance and battle Vader, Palpatine, and his Galactic Empire . The sequel trilogy features Kylo Ren (Ben Solo)\u2014the son of Leia and Han Solo , nephew and former Jedi apprentice of Luke, and grandson of Padm\u00e9 and Anakin\u2014who fell to the dark side and seeks to rule the galaxy with Rey , the granddaughter of Palpatine and the last Jedi apprentice of Luke and Leia.\nEach episodic film begins with an opening crawl , accompanied by the main Star Wars theme by John Williams , who composes the scores for each film. All nine films\u2014most notably the original trilogy\u2014have had retroactive changes made after their initial theatrical releases.\n|Film||U.S. release date||Director||Screenwriter(s)||Story by||Producer(s)||Refs|\n|Prequel trilogy|\n|Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace||May 19, 1999||George Lucas||Rick McCallum||[3]|\n|Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones||May 16, 2002||George Lucas||George Lucas and Jonathan Hales||George Lucas||[4] [5]|\n|Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith||May 19, 2005||George Lucas||[6] [7]|\n|Original trilogy|\n|Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope||May 25, 1977||George Lucas||Gary Kurtz||[8] [9]|\n|Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back||May 21, 1980||Irvin Kershner||Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan||George Lucas||[10] [11]|\n|Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi||May 25, 1983||Richard Marquand||Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas||Howard Kazanjian||[12] [13]|\n|Sequel trilogy|\n|Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens||December 18, 2015||J.

[19] The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985), the first of which was screened internationally after being produced for television . [20]\nAfter the conclusion of his then-six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series . An animated film, The Clone Wars (2008), was released as a pilot to a TV series of the same name . An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, [21] described by Disney chief financial officer (CFO) Jay Rasulo as origin stories . [22] The first entry, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before Episode IV . [23] [24] Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian .\n|Film||Release date||Director||Screenwriter(s)||Story by||Producer(s)||Refs|\n|The Clone Wars||August 15, 2008||Dave Filoni||Henry Gilroy , Steven Melching, and Scott Murphy||George Lucas, Dave Filoni, and Henry Gilroy||Catherine Winder||[25]|\nPreceding the airing of the animated TV series in late 2008, the theatrical feature Star Wars: The Clone Wars was compiled from episodes \"almost [as] an afterthought.\" [26] [27] It reveals that Anakin trained an apprentice between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith ; the series explains Padawan Ahsoka Tano 's absence from the latter film.

[21] In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger made public the development of a Kasdan film [31] and Entertainment Weekly reported that it would focus on Han Solo. [32] Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories . [22] Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was \"no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.\" [33] The standalone films are subtitled \"A Star Wars Story\" . [23] [34]\nMain article: Rogue One\nRogue One is set directly before Episode IV: A New Hope and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star. [35] Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen ) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn . Galen secretly sends a defecting Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook , to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera . Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to help Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor and his droid K-2SO retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.\nThe idea for the movie came from John Knoll , the chief creative officer of Industrial Light & Magic . [36] In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced Gareth Edwards as the director of an anthology film, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016. [37] The film's title was revealed to be Rogue One , with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and Felicity Jones in the starring role. [38] Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Luna also play new characters, [39] with James Earl Jones returning to voice Darth Vader . [40] Edwards stated, \"It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy.\" [41] The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated Star Wars TV series, namely The Clone Wars ' Saw Gerrera, portrayed by Forest Whitaker in the film. The movie received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised. The film grossed over US$500 million worldwide within a week of its release. [42]\nSolo , the second anthology film, focuses on Han Solo about 10 years before A New Hope . [35] After an escape attempt from his Imperial-occupied home planet of Corellia goes wrong, a young Han vows to return to rescue his girlfriend Qi'ra . Han \"Solo\" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior. Han and his newfound Wookiee friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Tobias Beckett . After angering gangster Dryden Vos, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him. Without a ship to travel, they hire Lando Calrissian , the captain and owner of the Millennium Falcon .\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired Star Wars original trilogy veteran Lawrence Kasdan to write a film about a young Han Solo. [21] The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi ), Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, and Woody Harrelson as Beckett. Lucasfilm originally hired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to direct, but they were fired during principal photography , and replaced by Ron Howard . A twist ending acknowledges one of the major story arcs of The Clone Wars and Rebels animated series, while leaving the story open ended for sequels. [43]\nIn mid-2018, Lucasfilm confirmed that multiple anthology films were in development, [44] with their release following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker . [45] Two films are scheduled for December 2025 and 2027. [46] [c]\nKathleen Kennedy stated in May 2022 that \"There's a couple of [filmmakers] that we've been in conversation with over quite a long period of time that I'm hoping will come in\" to oversee future films in the same way that Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have done for multiple Star Wars television series. [48] Kennedy stated that \"We need to create a whole new saga\" [49] and that the sequel trilogy era was likely to be expanded from. [50]\nThree separate new live-action films were officially announced at April 2023's Star Wars Celebration : a film about the dawn of the Jedi (set 25,000 years before A New Hope ) by James Mangold , a Dave Filoni-helmed film concluding the story set up by The Mandalorian and its spin-offs, and a Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy -helmed film set 15 years after The Rise of Skywalker , with Daisy Ridley reprising her role as Rey. [51] [52] Upcoming films were announced to include the trademark opening crawl.

THR reported that according to its sources, \"the project is intended as a stand-alone but in success could lead to more movies\", taking place after the sequel trilogy and possibly featuring some of its characters. [54] [55] [56] In March 2023, it was reported that Lindelof and Britt-Gibson had left the project in mid-February and that Steven Knight was hired to replace them as screenwriter. Filming was reportedly set to begin in February 2024. [57] [58]\nAt April 2023's Star Wars Celebration, Kennedy officially announced a Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy-directed movie, with Daisy Ridley returning as Rey as she constructs a new Jedi Order 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker . [51] She reportedly may be a supporting character in the vein of Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker in the original and sequel trilogies, respectively. [59] Lucasfilm reportedly hoped to release the film on the next scheduled date planned for a Star Wars film: December 19, 2025. [60]\nOn May 4 , 2020, Taika Waititi (who directed the first-season finale of The Mandalorian and voiced IG-11 ) was officially announced to direct a Star Wars film from a screenplay he was co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns . [61] As of May 2022, his film was expected to be released before Rogue Squadron [62] (originally scheduled for December 2023 prior to its delay), [48] [47] with Kathleen Kennedy asserting that Waititi's film may be released in late 2023. [63] In June 2022, Waititi agreed with Kennedy's view that the films should move into new territory in favor of origin stories, [64] and stated he would continue writing the project through the end of 2022 while filming other projects. [65] In early July, The Hollywood Reporter indicated that \"an early 2023 start\" was being considered. [66] The movie will reportedly be shot in Los Angeles. [67] By March 2023, Waititi was also likely to appear in the film. [68] By April 2023, Kennedy stated that Waititi was now writing the film alone. [69] At the beginning of May 2023, Deadline Hollywood stated that filming for his film would begin in 2024. [70]\nRian Johnson , the writer/director of The Last Jedi (2017), is confirmed to write and direct the first film of a new trilogy he was outlining as of early 2019 with Ram Bergman producing alongside Kennedy. [71] [72] [73] It was said to differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters and possibly a different era than the main film franchise. [74] The project was considered to have been \"back-burnered\" by May 2022 due to Johnson's involvement with other projects, including the Knives Out franchise. [62] In October, Johnson indicated that he would make at least one more film in that series before returning to Star Wars . [75] By April 2023, Kennedy agreed with Johnson that he would return to Star Wars after at least one more Knives Out film. [76]\nIn November 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Shawn Levy was in talks to direct a Star Wars film, following his work on Deadpool 3 (2024) and the fifth and final season of Stranger Things . [77]\nThe first spin-off film (also the first sequel to be released) was a holiday TV special aired in 1978. Two live-action TV films created in the mid-1980s feature the Ewoks.\n|Film||Release date||Director||Screenwriter(s)||Network|\n|Star Wars Holiday Special||November 17, 1978||Steve Binder||Pat Proft , Leonard Ripps, Bruce Vilanch , Rod Warren and Mitzie Welch||CBS|\nProduced for CBS in 1978, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a two-hour television special, in the format of a variety show . Stars of the original film and archive footage from the original Star Wars film appeared alongside celebrity guest stars in plot-related skits, musical numbers, and an animated segment, all loosely tied together by the premise of Chewbacca 's family waiting for his arrival for the \"Life Day\" celebration on his home planet, Kashyyyk . The special is notorious for its extremely negative reception and was aired only once. [78] Only the 11-minute animated sequence, which features the debut of bounty hunter Boba Fett , was positively received. [79]\nThe Ewoks from Return of the Jedi were featured in two spin-off television films, The Ewok Adventure and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor . Both aired on ABC on the Thanksgiving weekends of 1984 and 1985, respectively, [80] with at least the first also being given a limited international theatrical release. [20] Warwick Davis reprised his debut role as the main Ewok, Wicket , in both. [81] [82] They are set between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi . [83] Both films were released on VHS, LaserDisc, and on a double-feature DVD. Although based on stories written by George Lucas, they do not bear Star Wars in their titles, and were considered to exist in a lower level of canon than the episodic films. Following Disney's acquisition of the franchise, they were excluded from the canon. [84] [20] The Battle for Endor would be the last live-action Star Wars television project produced by Lucasfilm until 2019's The Mandalorian .\n|Film||Release date||Director(s)||Screenwriter(s)||Story by||Network|\n|The Ewok Adventure [d]||November 25, 1984||John Korty||Bob Carrau||George Lucas||ABC|\n|Ewoks: The Battle for Endor||November 24, 1985||Jim Wheat and Ken Wheat|\nIn a story by Lucas and a screenplay by Bob Carrau, the Towani family spaceship shipwrecks on the forest moon of Endor . While trying to repair their ship, the castaway family is split, when a giant creature known as the Gorax kidnaps the parents. Taking pity on the kids, a group of native Ewoks led by Wicket decides to help little Cindel Towani and her older brother Mace, rescue their parents. [81] [82] Among other stylistic choices making the film unique from the Star Wars episodes is the inclusion of a narrator. [85]\nThe sequel focuses on the Ewoks protecting their village from marauders led by the evil Lord Terak, who killed all the members of the Towani family except for Cindel, in search of a power battery. [81] It was followed by the TV series Ewoks (1985\u20131987).\nIn December 2020, A Droid Story , an animated adventure film for Disney+ was announced. According to the official Star Wars Twitter , the \"epic journey will introduce us to a new hero guided by R2-D2 and C-3PO .\" [86]\nThe Star Wars films are the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time worldwide, behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe , having grossed over $10 billion at the global box office.

[151] [152] [153] 35mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints, [154] [155] but it was later revealed that the Library possessed a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases. By 2015, Star Wars had been transferred to a 2K scan which can be viewed by appointment. [156]\nCaravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure was one of four films to be juried-awarded Emmys for Outstanding Special Visual Effects at the 37th Primetime Emmy Awards . [157] The film was additionally nominated for Outstanding Children's Program but lost in this category to an episode of American Playhouse . [158]\nAt the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards , Ewoks: The Battle for Endor and the CBS documentary Dinosaur! were both juried-awarded Emmys for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. [159] The film additionally received two nominations for Outstanding Children's Program and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Special. [160] [161]\nIn the 2000s Zack Snyder pitched an adult-oriented film to Lucasfilm, but conversations ceased by the time Disney acquired the company in 2012. The project was redeveloped as Rebel Moon (2023). [162]\nIn early 2013, Bob Iger announced the development of a spin-off film written by Simon Kinberg , [163] reported by Entertainment Weekly to focus on bounty hunter Boba Fett during the original trilogy. [164] In mid-2014, Josh Trank was officially announced as the director of an undisclosed spin-off film, [165] but had left the project a year later due to creative differences, [166] causing a teaser for the film to be scrapped from Star Wars Celebration. [167] By October 2018, the Fett film [e] was reportedly no longer in production, with the studio instead focusing on The Mandalorian , which utilizes a similar character. [169]\nRogue One and Solo actors Felicity Jones, Alden Ehrenreich and Emilia Clarke all stated that their contracts also included future installments. [170] [171] [172] Solo director Ron Howard said that while no sequel was in development, it was up to the fans to decide. [173] Kennedy and Glover also said that a film focusing on Lando could happen, but was not a priority. [174] (A Lando series was later announced.) [175] Although critics noted that Solo left room open for sequels, [45] in 2022, Howard confirmed that the studio had no plans to make one. [176]\nIn August 2017, it was rumored that films focused on Jabba the Hutt , and Jedi Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda were being considered or were in development. [177] Stephen Daldry was reportedly in early negotiations to co-write and direct the Obi-Wan movie. [178] At D23 Expo in August 2019, a TV series about the character was announced to be produced instead, which was released in 2022. [179]\nGame of Thrones creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were to write and produce a trilogy of Star Wars films scheduled to be released in December 2022, 2024, and 2026, [180] which were first announced to be in development in February 2018. [181] The duo stepped away from the project in October 2019, citing their commitment to a Netflix deal, although Kennedy stated her openness to their returning when their schedules allow. [182] [180]\nIn April 2019, Kathleen Kennedy was asked by MTV News about a potential Knights of the Old Republic adaption and stated, \"Yes, we are developing something to look at. Right now, I have no idea where things might fall.\" [183] The following month, BuzzFeed News reported that Laeta Kalogridis had been hired in the spring of 2018 to write a film based on the 2003 video game , and that she was close to completing the first script of a potential trilogy. [184]\nIn September 2019, Marvel Cinematic Universe producer Kevin Feige reportedly began developing a Star Wars film with Kennedy; [185] Michael Waldron was later announced to write the screenplay. [186] [f] In May 2022, Waldron confirmed the project was moving forward and that it would more or less stand alone, [188] however in a separate interview the same month Kennedy denied that the film was in active development. [62] By March 2023, it was reportedly confirmed to no longer be in development. [68] Contrary to earlier comments, Kennedy clarified the following month that the project was more something conflated through the media, that \"nothing ever got developed. We never discussed an idea... If [Feige] did come up with something, I would be all ears. But, that's never really happened, so it's not an abandoned project. It just never really happened.\" [189]\nJ. D. Dillard and Luke Cage writer Matt Owens were reportedly involved in the early stages of developing a film in February 2020, [190] which may have taken place on the Sith planet Exegol . [191] In November 2022, Dillard announced that he was no longer involved in the project. [192]\nOn December 10, 2020, during Disney Investor Day, Wonder Woman (2017) director Patty Jenkins was announced as the director of a film titled Rogue Squadron , initially set to be released on December 22, 2023. [193] [c] [g] According to the official Star Wars website, the film would \"introduce a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy.\" [175] According to Jenkins, the film would be an original story \"with great influence from the games and the books \". [194] A script was being worked on as of December 2020, [195] at which time, Wonder Woman 3 's story was still being worked on. [196] Matthew Robinson was hired to write Rogue Squadron in May 2021; [197] [198] late the next month, Jenkins revealed that the script was almost finished. [199] On November 8, the film's production was delayed from 2022 due to Jenkins' busy schedule. [200] A month later, Jenkins had left her planned Cleopatra film as director in order to focus on Rogue Squadron and Wonder Woman 3 . [201] Disney announced in April 2022 that the film was still set to be released in December 2023. [202] Kathleen Kennedy stated in May that the film has been \"pushed off to the side for the moment\", with the script still being worked on and Waititi's film expected to be released first. [48] On September 15, 2022, the film was confirmed to be taken off from Disney's release schedule, [47] although in December Jenkins said she was actively working on it amid the apparent cancellation of Wonder Woman 3 . [203] By March 2023, fans reported it as no longer in development. [68] The following month, Kennedy stated the project could still happen either as a film or a television series.

Ltd , it starred Saurabh Raj Jain , Pooja Sharma , Shaheer Sheikh and Aham Sharma . [6]\nThe story begins with Bhishma , the son of Shantanu and Ganga , taking his oath of celibacy to convince Satyavati to marry his father Shantanu , the king of Hastinapura . Shantanu and Satyavati marry and have 2 children - Chitrangada and Vichitravirya . Chitrangad dies and on the advice of queen Saytavati Bhisma wins the three princesses of Kashi kingdom for Vichitravirya but the eldest Princess Amba refuses to marry him and leaves for her lover who rejects her. She blames Bhisma and vows that she will be the reason of his death. Vichitravirya died without any children, but Veda Vyasa , the son of Satyavati born through occult is requested to impregnate Vichitravirya's 2 wives Ambika and Ambalika the same way he was conceived. Besides the queens, Vyasa also impregnates a maid Parishrami through occult. Soon, Ambika gives birth to Dhritarashtra , born blind, Ambalika gives birth to Pandu , born pale and Parashrami gives birth to Vidura .\nDhritarashtra is married to Gandhari , the princess of Gandhara Kingdom ; because of her boon of bearing a hundred sons. After knowing her would-be-husband is blind Gandhari decided to blindfold herself to share her husband's pain. This angers Shakuni , the brother of Gandhari, and he vows to destroy Bhishma, as it was him who had brought the proposal for Gandhari's marriage. Dhritarashtra is denied the throne for being blind, and the throne is given to Pandu. Pandu marries Kunti , a princess of Kunti Kingdom , and Madri of Madra Kingdom . Pandu is later cursed by Sage Kindama, that he will die if he attempts to impregnate his wives. Pandu, heartbroken, renounces the kingdom with his 2 wives. After this Dhritarashtra becomes de facto king of Hastinapur.\nKunti uses her boon, given to her by Sage Durvasa , to invoke gods of her choice and obtain children from them. She begets Yudhishthira from Yama (the god of death and righteousness), Bhima from Vayu (the god of wind), Arjuna from Indra (the king of the gods). She also chants the boon for Madri, and Madri obtains twins - Nakula and Sahadeva - from the Ashwini Kumaras . Gandhari is jealous by this development and gives birth to a lump of flesh after being pregnant for 2 years, but this is cut into 101 pieces by Veda Vyasa, and these pieces eventually transform into children - the 100 Kauravas (led by Duryodhana ) and a daughter, Dushala .\nYears pass, and the Kauravas grow up to be evil, led by their eldest brother Duryodhana , who is highly influenced by his uncle Shakuni , contrary to the Pandavas who are righteous. Pandavas return to Hastinapur with Kunti, after the death of Pandu and Madri. Shakuni tries to poison Bheema, but he is saved by his great-grandfather Naag Raj. Bhishma banishes Shakuni from Hastinapur, forcing him to return to Gandhar. All princes are sent to study under Guru Dronacharya where Dronacharya teaches everyone about warfare including his son Ashwatthama .\nYears pass and the princes return to Hastinapur, where they are engaged in a competition of showcasing their skills. Arjuna wins the competition, but Karna challenges Arjuna as Dronacharya declared Arjuna as the greatest bowman of the world. Kunti realises that Karna is her son whom she had obtained from Surya , the Sun God, long before marriage. In the meantime, Arjuna, also befriends Lord Krishna , his cousin (Lord Krishna's father was Vasudev, brother of Kunti), and King of Dwarka . The Kauravas attempt to kill the Pandavas using a palace made of wax , but the Pandavas escape. They go into exile so all others believe them to be dead. In the process, the Pandavas encounter a demon by the name Hidimba . Bhima kills Hidimba but ends up marrying his sister, Hidimbi . The couple begets a son, Ghatotkacha . Arjune disguised as a Brahmin wins Draupadi in her Swayamvar arranged by her father, the King of Panchal, Drupad. Arjuna takes her to his mother who was doing Pooja and without realising what he was talking about commands him to share whatever he has won with his brothers. The Pandavas eventually marry Draupadi , the princess of Panchala and King Drupada 's daughter, born from fire, thus revealing their identity. They return to Hastinapur and justify their polyandry.\nThe sequence of events leads to the Kuru Kingdom being divided - The Pandavas receive a new kingdom - Khandavprastha . Arjuna destroys the Khandava. They renovate the town, and rename it as Indraprastha . The prosperity of Indraprastha angers Duryodhana. A jealous Duryodhana summons Pandavas for a dice game, where Yudhishthira loses his kingdom, brothers as well as their common wife Draupadi . Draupadi is dragged and humiliated in the court, however, Krishna saves her honour at the end.\nThe Pandavas and Draupadi, as a result of losing, are forced into a 12-year exile and a year of incognito, the latter phase being spent in the kingdom of King Virata .Arjun got pasupatashtra from lord shiva . Pandavas reunite with their children- the Upapandavas (the 5 sons of Draupadi) and Abhimanyu (the son of Arjuna and Subhadra), after the exile period. Abhimanyu is married to Uttaraa , the daughter of King Virata and Queen Sudeshna .\nThe Pandavas' peace treaty with the Kauravas fails to materialise, thus confirming that a war is set to happen. Both, the Pandavas and Kauravas, gather their respective armies by allying with different tribes and kingdoms.\nShortly before the Kurukshetra War commences, Arjuna obtains the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita from Krishna, which helps him fight for righteousness without any remorse of killing his own people in the process. The war begins and continues for 18 days - both sides face mass destruction. The Pandavas and Kauravas lose all of their children, in-laws, and allies, and the war officially ends after Duryodhana, the only remaining Kaurava, is killed by Bhima.\nAshwatthama (the son of Dronacharya ), on seeing Duryodhana's death, gets angered and raids the Pandava camp at night, killing many soldiers in the process.

[11] In 2006 it was revealed making for Star Plus which was to be directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi . [12] [13] It was a part of Bedi's 360 degree approach to the epic through TV, film, gaming and theme parks. [14] Planned for 100 episodes with new actors, it was planned to premiere in March 2008 but got postpone due to production to August 2008 and later January 2009. [13] [15] [16]\nDuring this, Ekta Kapoor was simultaneously producing a series on Mahabharat since January 2008 titled Kahaani Hamaarey Mahaabhaarat Ki for a rival channel to premiere in mid 2008 which she earlier planned for Star but could not as the channel roped Bedi. [17] [18] This led on to a pressure in the production as they wanted to rush their premiere before Kapoor due to which Dwivedi quit midway after association with them for two years after which three directors were working on it. [19] [20] But, they were not able to rush up the series before Kapoor's. 50 episodes were shot at the sets created in Morna between Noida and Delhi for a year after paying \u20b96 Crores. [16] However, as the channel was not satisfied with those episodes, they were asked to rework the entire series again pushing its premiere to 2009. But, Bedi reportedly started selling it in DVDs which created problems between them and the channel, and the production was stalled. [16] However, in December 2008, Star took Bedi to Bombay High Court filing an arbitration petition alleging that the production house took \u20b96 Crore for the production of the series in advance but has not produced even a single episode while a senior executive from the production house stated, \" This legal notice is Star's way of pulling out of the show. Maybe it doesn't want to go ahead with the Mahabharat project after all.\" [21] After these, the shooting was expected to restart from February 2009 but in mid 2009 the production was cancelled and the project was given over to Siddharth Kumar Tewary 's Swastik Productions to start fresh. [22] [16]\nMore than 400 people were involved in production with 200 people working on graphics. [24] Renowned author Devdutt Pattanaik was roped as the chief consultant and guiding person for the series. [25] Also writer Salim Khan, music directors Ajay-Atul and Ismail Darbar and action director Ram Shetty were involved. [26]\nSpeaking about bringing Mahabharat to television again, Star Plus senior vice-president Nikhil Madhok said, \"With over 20 years having passed since the telecast of Mahabharat serial on Doordarshan , we felt that the younger generation should be re-introduced to this epic. Also, the plot of this epic is open to interpretation and has many intricacies in it, unlike that of let's say Ramayan, which is fairly linear and is passed on from generation to generation.\" [27]\nAccording to producer Siddharth Kumar Tewary , the Draupadi cheer haran (disrobing) sequence, which Tewary himself directed, took 20 days to shoot. [28]\nEven in the last fight between Bheema and Duryodhana, the actors shared that the scene took 3 days to shoot. [29]\nOriginally planned for 129 episodes, its growing popularity gave an extension for about 100 more episodes as Tewary wanted to explore the story further in January 2014. [30] [31] However, it ended with 267 episodes.\nThe set covering 10 acres of land in Umargam , Valsad , Gujarat was designed by the art director Omung Kumar. [32]\nThe costume designer of the series Nidhi Yasha along with her consultant Bhanu Athaiya , had referred 450 books related to period textiles, costume and jewellery. [33] [34]\nDifferent ancient techniques have been used to achieve the various looks. A lot of bright coloured silks, handlooms, gold and jewellery structured embroidery patterns have been used.\nStar spent \u20b9 5.1 billion (US$64 million) on the project and spent another \u20b9 410 million (US$5.1 million) on marketing the show, making it India's most expensive TV series. [37] As a part of marketing, Star constructed Mahabharat museum across malls in cities consisting selective weapons, jewellery and finery of Mahabharat along with 3D virtual tour of the sets of Hastinapur. [38] In towns the same concept was adapted with wheels-canter vans along with LED. [38]\nThe sets of the series at Umargam in Gujarat cost \u20b9100 crores and production costs of \u20b913-15 Lakhs per day. [39] [40]\nThe series was mainly shot in the sets at Umargam, Valsad in Gujarat. [41] [32] Shooting also took place in various exotic locations such as Jaisalmer , Amber Palace in Jaipur, Kashmir , Ahmedabad , Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka . [42] [43] [44] [24]\nThe actors shared that they had to go through acting workshops and various trainings for about a year where they were explained in detail what to do and how. [45] [46] [47] Rajit Kapur trained the actors by conducting acting workshops.

[54]\nHindustan Times criticised, \"Everything is so exaggerated that you feel you are watching a series of unreal events rather than following a deeply emotional story.

[64] [65]\nThis series is regarded as the costliest show ever launched by StarPlus and one of the costliest Indian television series, being the first Indian television show to be made on a budget more than \u20b9100 crores.

{"question": "How does our brain \"choose\" how long to sleep?", "claim": "This sleep drive gets stronger every hour we are awake and causes us to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.", "claim_raw_string": "This sleep drive gets stronger every hour we are awake and causes us to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.", "response": "Our brain determines how long we sleep through a combination of our **central circadian clock** and **homeostasis**. The central circadian clock, located in our brain, tells us when it is time for sleep by being in sync with certain cues in the environment such as light and darkness. Homeostasis is the process by which our body keeps our systems steady and a compound called adenosine is linked to this need for sleep. This sleep drive gets stronger every hour we are awake and causes us to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.", "references": ["Image\nSleep is an important part of your daily routine\u2014you spend about one-third of your time doing it. Quality sleep \u2013 and getting enough of it at the right times -- is as essential to survival as food and water. Without sleep you can\u2019t form or maintain the pathways in your brain that let you learn and create new memories, and it\u2019s harder to concentrate and respond quickly.\nSleep is important to a number of brain functions, including how nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other. In fact, your brain and body stay remarkably active while you sleep. Recent findings suggest that sleep plays a housekeeping role that removes toxins in your brain that build up while you are awake.\nEveryone needs sleep, but its biological purpose remains a mystery. Sleep affects almost every type of tissue and system in the body \u2013 from the brain, heart, and lungs to metabolism, immune function, mood, and disease resistance. Research shows that a chronic lack of sleep, or getting poor quality sleep, increases the risk of disorders including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity.\nSleep is a complex and dynamic process that affects how you function in ways scientists are now beginning to understand. This booklet describes how your need for sleep is regulated and what happens in the brain during sleep.\nExpand accordion content"], "citation_links": ["https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-understanding-sleep"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_df32ed48-f794-4e0d-ac96-50c2f137d1f5"}

The Instax Mini LiPlay is the best for printing both digital and analogue. The Polaroid 600 Box-Type Cameras are iconic for their boxy design and were first released in 1981.", "references": ["Instant film has made a big comeback in recent years. Fujifilm's Instax business, for instance, has enjoyed mainstream success. And you can still buy film for many old Polaroid cameras despite various ownership and branding changes over the year. Don't forget about the newer Panasonic models that use modern I-Type film packs either.\nThere are lots of reasons to reach for an instant camera. First and foremost, nothing in the digital realm beats the feeling of handing off a physical photo to someone right after you've snapped it. That's why instant film is a big hit at weddings and parties; it can be a great way to capture moments for posterity in a way that's very different than just another smartphone image . Younger millennials and Gen Z photographers might also look to it as a step away from the digital doldrums, and a way to keep any truly private images away from hackable cloud data services. And you can't discount artists, who are always looking to make their work stand out in a crowded landscape.\nRead on for the top instant cameras we've tested, followed by everything you need to know to find the right one for you.\nBuying Guide: The Best Instant Cameras for 2023\nGetting your head around the various instant film formats is an important first step before you make a purchase decision. Let's start with the most popular option, Fujifilm's Instax Mini. This film is about the size of a credit card when you take its border into account, and the image area measures 2.4 by 1.8 inches (HW).\nFujifilm Instax Mini 11 (Credit: Jim Fisher)\nFilm is available in color or monochrome, and is compatible with tons of cameras from Fujifilm, Leica, Lomography, and Mint. Our favorite entry-level model, the Fujifilm Instax Mini 11 , sells for about $70 and is available in many colors. If you're a more serious shutterbug, consider the Lomo'Instant Automat Glass , which has a wider-angle lens (better for selfies) and supports multiple exposure images.\nColor Instax Mini film is pretty affordable. Prices vary a bit across retailers, but you should expect to spend between $0.50 and $0.60 per photo. Black-and-white film is a little pricier, at around $0.80 per image. And if you want film with colorful borders or other special finishes, the costs can double from there. Buying in bulk is one way to save money in the long run.\nThe Lomography Lomo'Instant Wide uses Instax Wide film (Credit: Paul Maljak)\nIf you prefer a bigger image, you can opt for the Instax Wide format, which is also available in color or black-and-white. The image size is about double that of Mini\u2014basically two mini shots side-by-side (2.4 by 3.9 inches). Thankfully, this film doesn't cost double that of Mini\u2014expect to spend around $0.75 per color photo and $1.30 for each black-and-white image.\nFor some photographers, instant film is film, which means a square format is a must. In that case, you want Fujifilm's Instax Square film. It has long been available in color, with a per-shot cost of about $1.00. Fujifilm has recently added Instax Square Monochrome to its catalog for black-and-white shots, but it's slightly pricier at close to $1.50 per frame.\nLomography Lomo'Instant Square (Credit: Zlata Ivleva)\nBut what if you've got an honest-to-goodness Polaroid camera? The company has been reborn in the 21st century\u2014it's gone through some name changes over the years, from the Impossible Project to Polaroid Originals, but today it's just called Polaroid. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\nYou can still get color or black-and-white film for an SX-70 or 600 series camera. It's expensive, though, at around $20 for a pack of eight shots. If you don't already have a vintage instant camera and like the idea of repurposing old tech, you can look to a shop like Mint Camera\n, or Polaroid\nitself to get a refurbished SX-70, 600 SLR, or another classic. We recently took a Retrospekt-restored SX-70 for a test drive\u2014check out our story if you're thinking about going the true vintage route.\nPolaroid film is bigger than Instax, but the quality of its color stock just isn't as good. Colors shift in cold temperatures, overall saturation isn't as deep, and you must take care to shield it from light as it develops. The black-and-white film is a lot better though. Both have a larger image area than Instax Square, so the more impactful image might make it worth the hassle.\nThe Polaroid Now+ is the lastest I-Type camera from the iconic brand (Credit: Jim Fisher)\nPolaroid makes new cameras too; the Now+ is the latest. It works with I-Type film ($17 per pack of eight shots) and supports Bluetooth connectivity for app-based remote control. It's a solid option for artistic photographers and includes a set of color balance filters for gel looks and better black-and-white photos.\nYou can go smaller, too. The tiny Polaroid Go uses similarly tiny film, available in color only. It's cute, but we think it's worth it to use classic Polaroid or Fujifilm Instax Square film because of their bigger image size.\nIf you've got an itch to shoot film again and don't want to have to find a local lab to develop your shots, instant film can scratch is a good alternative. It deliver results that almost match digital in their immediacy.\nIf you have a favorite image that you shot with a digital camera and want to preserve it on instant film, you're in luck. You can print any photo from your smartphone onto Instax Mini film using the Instax Mini Link , onto Instax Wide with the Link Wide , or onto the square format with the Instax Share SP-3 or Polaroid Lab .\nOn the flip side, you can also digitize your instant prints.

The image above comes from a study done by researchers at the University of Alberta, Canada, who raised three breeds of chickens from different eras in the exact same way and measured how much they ate and how they grew. This allowed them to see the genetic differences between the breeds without influences from other factors like food or antibiotic use. They recently published their results in Poultry Science.\n1) Chickens today are much bigger than those in the 1950s: This one's pretty obvious. The 2005 chicken breed on the right ended up being about four times as heavy, on average, as the 1957 breed on the left \u2014 despite being fed the same foods.\n2) Chickens today are more efficient at turning feed into meat: The reason for that is that modern-day chickens are more efficient at turning feed into breast meat. The researchers' metric for this was something they called the \"breast conversion rate\" of grams of feed into grams of breast meat. The 2005 breed was roughly three times as efficient as the 1950s one.\n3) Modern chickens also have extra health problems: Previous research has noted increased bone , heart , and immune system problems in some contemporary chicken breeds. Health problems could come from several factors, including both unintentional genetic effects and behavioral differences such as diet and carrying around all that extra weight.\n4) But the growth of chickens has helped make chicken a popular food: Over the past few decades, chicken has become a much cheaper food. And Americans have been eating more of it. (The price of poultry has risen at about half the rate of other consumer goods from 1960 to 2004.) In 2013, Americans consumed more than 83 pounds of chicken per person.\nAccording to the Poultry Science paper, our ability to breed bigger, more efficient chickens had played a big part in that.\nHat tips to John R.

{"question": "how to use oil diffuser", "claim": "4. Turn on the diffuser and enjoy!", "claim_raw_string": "4. Turn on the diffuser and enjoy!", "response": "To use an oil diffuser, you should:1. Choose a location for the diffuser 2. Fill the water reservoir with water 3. Add 3-10 drops of essential oils to the water 4. Turn on the diffuser and enjoy!", "references": ["Besides making your room smell like a spa, here's what they actually do\nIn This Article\nThe most effective wellness routines are those that fit easily into your daily life. Think of oil diffusers as a low-effort entry into self-care: they bring elements of wellness into your home, transforming your space into a tranquil nest where you can (sometimes literally) breathe easier. These aromatic room fresheners require minimal effort for you to recharge your d\u00e9cor and up your self-care game in the process. Proceed with caution, though\u2014diffusing essential oils can be super powerful, and not everyone should do it.\nTo learn more about what essential oil diffusers do, we got in touch with wellness expert Esme Benjamin and medical doctor Shirin Peters.\nMeet the Expert\n- Esme Benjamin is a wellness expert, personal trainer, and cofounder of Beccomotion , an online fitness studio.\n- Shirin Peters , MD, is the founder of the Bethany Medical Clinic in New York.\nBelow, everything you need to know about oil diffusers.\nTo put it simply, an oil diffuser is a device that breaks essential oils down into smaller molecules, dispersing them into the air for a pleasant or calming effect\u2014depending on the oil that's been put into the diffuser. Different essential oils have different claims\u2014for example, lavender is meant to support sleep. 1 The diffuser's job is to evenly disperse the particles at a comfortable concentration that's easy to breathe and doesn't overbear the room.\nPlain and simple, a diffuser is used to fill the air in a room with tiny, breathable particles of beneficial essential oils\u2014giving the room a calmer, more pleasant-smelling ambiance. \u201cIt's well known that scent is associated strongly with memory,\u201d says Benjamin. \u201cWhen I diffuse lemongrass oil it reminds me of Thailand, my happy place, and I instantly feel a vacation-level chill come over me. Oils just set a tone for your space and the activity you're performing that day.\u201d\nThere are four main types of oil diffusers on the market right now. You can choose your diffuser based on the intensity of the effect desired, and of course, the limitations of your space.\n- Nebulizing Diffusers: These diffusers work by using pressurized air to diffuse a mist of oil. A vacuum pulls oil to the surface of a distribution tube resulting in a burst of aroma into the air. Nebulizing diffusers don\u2019t require water or heat, which makes them a low-maintenance choice. These are plastic-free for the eco-conscious user.\n- Ultrasonic or Humidifying Diffusers: Ultrasonic vibrations break up oil molecules to create a fine mist. You will need to dilute the essential oil with water for the diffuser\u2019s electronic frequencies to release the oil into a mist. Ultrasonic diffusers work like cold humidifiers, which makes them a great choice if you want to add moisture to the air, especially during cold season . The plastic ultrasonic parts require cleaning as oils can be corrosive to plastic.\n- Evaporative Diffusers: In this type of diffuser, a small fan helps turn oil into gas, making oil evaporate into the air. However, as the oil evaporates, it loses some of its potency. So, this is a good choice for people who want a quick, occasional aromatic sensation.\n- Heat or Electric Diffusers: Instead of using a fan to turn oil to gas, a heat diffuser uses heat, most commonly, electric. Heating oil may change its chemical properties making the oil less or more intense depending on its properties. Because there\u2019s no fan involved, these diffusers are silent. Different types of heat diffusers include candle diffusers, electric heat diffusers, and lamp ring diffusers.\nThere are also some tricked-out oil diffusers on the market with cool features like ambient lighting and sound features. Design-led ceramic or reed oil diffusers give your space a wellness vibe, whether you opt for a minimalist or hygge aesthetic. Oil diffusers with automatic switch-offs or timers are a good choice if you plan to use your diffuser for extended periods or to fall asleep.\nUsing an oil diffuser can help you breathe easier, and not just because you\u2019re tapping into your zen. \u201cMany essential oils have reputed medicinal or therapeutic uses, like eucalyptus for colds and respiratory issues,\u201d 2 says Benjamin. Peters adds that many of the essential oils that have a calming effect can help reduce blood pressure in someone who is hypertensive. \"Eucalyptus oil clears airways when they are congested due to allergies and cold and can help with sleep and recovery to health in these situations. Basil oil can help with digestion and muscle aches,\" she says. \"Many of the medicinal benefits are more noticeable when the essential oil is ingested in small quantities or applied to the skin directly instead of being vaporized and inhaled.\"\nJust as you might blend notes in perfume oil , you can harmonize different essences in your oil diffuser and create a signature blend. Choose notes not only for their scent but for their healing properties. For an energy-boosting combination, try a blend of bergamot and cardamom. Bergamot has a dry citrus note that instantly uplifts while cardamom is great for focus and mentally clarifying. If it's relaxation you seek, go for a blend of geranium, frankincense, and mandarin. Geranium is balancing and calming, Frankincense will deepen and slow your breath, and mandarin will bring a sweetness to the blend and add a gentle elevating aroma.\nBeyond this, Benjamin says that diffusing oil as a daily ritual can help encourage good habits associated with particular scents. \u201cFor example, using lavender oil when I get home from work has become a signal it's time to start winding down, get off technology, run a bath , read a book, and so on,\" she says.\nEven with their benefits, diffusers can come with some drawbacks. \"Diffusers that use water can harbor bacteria in the liquid when it's left sitting, and this can make you very sick the next time you turn on the device,\" warns Peters. \"Pets, pregnant women, and infants under two should avoid using an essential oil diffuser because they may be more sensitive. If they have a sensitivity or allergy to any particular oil, it can make them ill when vaporized.\" Headache, nausea, and rashes are the most common allergy symptoms.\nIf you do have a reaction to an oil, make sure there is a way to quickly ventilate the space\u2014such as turning on a fan or opening up windows\u2014to minimize your symptoms.\nIncorporating an oil diffuser into your home or workspace can make you feel like you\u2019re living in a spa, which we are all about. \"If you have not had a reaction to a short exposure to a particular essential oil it would be fine to try having the diffuser on overnight while sleeping,\" says Peters. That said, if you have any health concerns, consult your physician about whether or not it's safe for you to use an oil diffuser.\nIf you experience headache, sore throat, or shortness of breath, discontinue use. Store essential oils out of children\u2019s reach and do not diffuse essential oils near infants for 12 months (for eucalyptus, peppermint wait 30 months). 3\nAs noted above, different types of oil diffusers require cleaning regimens. You don\u2019t have to clean a diffuser after each use. \u201cI like the way a little residue from the previous oil blends with today's scent,\u201d says Benjamin, but a daily quick-clean can\u2019t hurt.\nIf you\u2019re so inclined, use the time you're cleaning out your diffuser to reset your daily intentions. Just make sure everything is unplugged before you start. Gently spill out any water and wipe the tank clean with a damp cloth and natural soap, as you want to avoid harsh cleansers. If your diffuser has a mister, you can swipe that with an alcohol-dipped Q-Tip. You can also run your diffuser with water and a couple of drops of vinegar for an occasional deep clean if that\u2019s your pleasure. Make sure to rinse and dry all equipment when complete.\nLet's be real, the Carri\u00e8re Fr\u00e8res fragrance diffuser looks equally as stunning in your bathroom as it does in your living room. We're fans of the ginger scent, which is spicy yet refreshing in all the best ways.\nVitruvi Stone Diffuser $119.00\nThis pick from Vitruvi does all the work for you. Just choose from the seven-hour interval or three-hour continuous settings and get ready to unwind.\nThe Handmade Soap Company Reed Diffuser in Lemongrass & Cedarwood $30.00\nThe Handmade Soap Company's lemongrass and cedarwood essential oil blend is not only relaxing after a long day, but it's free of the nasties (think: parabens , SLS, petrochemicals, and other synthetics).\nHyascent Bright As You Are $178.00\nHome d\u00e9cor meets oil diffusers with the Hyascent fragrance diffuser. The diffuser was born from the simple need for a high-quality home fragrance diffuser that doesn\u2019t require sticks, cords, outlets, batteries, or apps\u2014and with its subtle yet ever-present aroma, it delivers."], "citation_links": ["https://www.byrdie.com/what-is-an-oil-diffuser-4766885"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_f3e096f1-493b-4dbb-b659-1a727a0495ab"}

It is thought to be a way of self-regulating sensory input. However, hand flapping does not necessarily mean that someone has autism, as many other children and adults also exhibit this behavior.", "references": ["If you\u2019re an autism parent, it is likely you\u2019ve seen your child present repetitive stimming (self-stimulatory) behaviors such as hand flapping, spinning, and shaking. These behaviors can be worrying if they\u2019re not fully understood.\nIn this guide, we will discuss everything you need to know about stimming in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and how to manage stimming behaviors.\nStimming is a shortened way of describing \u201cself-stimulation\u201d. In a nutshell, stimming refers to self-stimulating behaviors, usually involving repetitive movements or sounds.\nAlthough stimming is one of many possible indicators a child might be on the autism spectrum or have ADHD, stimming behavior does not necessarily mean a person is neurodivergent.\nA person who stims tends to show repetitive body movements (such as rocking) that can involve all five senses, or they might move objects in a repetitive motion. You might also hear stimming referred to as \u201cstereotypy.\u201d\nStimming can take the form of hand flapping, verbal noises or tics, other movements such as rocking, and many more behaviors. There are several reasons stimming can occur in children and adults with autism.\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the main types of stimming and the possible triggers.\nOf all the stimming behaviors, hand flapping is perhaps one that is most noticeable in children with ASD. It is a type of repetitive behavior that can occur for short or long durations.\nHand flapping can present itself as a stimming behavior in many ways, including:\n- Moving fingers vigorously\n- Clicking fingers\n- Moving arms\nMost of the time, hand flapping is nothing to worry about and the behavior can be triggered by any of the following:\n- Excitement\n- Nervousness\n- Fidgeting\n- Decreased body movements\nHand flapping is only a cause for concern if it results in self-harm or gets in the way of the child\u2019s daily living, through limiting the use of his/her hands.\nAuditory stimming is any repetitive behavior that has the potential to impact a person\u2019s sense of hearing or effective communication. It may include:\n- Repetitive speech (learned words such as song lyrics, movie lines, book passages)\n- Covering or tapping of ears, snapping fingers, or tapping on objects repeatedly\n- Humming, grunting, or high-pitched noises\nVisual stimming is a behavior that is connected to a person\u2019s sense of sight. It may include:\n- Staring blankly at objects\n- Hand flapping (as described above)\n- Lining up objects such as toys\n- Blinking repeatedly\n- Turning lights on and off\nTactile stimming refers to repetitive behaviors connected to a person\u2019s sense of touch. Examples may include:\n- Rubbing or scratching of hands or objects\n- Repetitive hand motions such as opening and closing fists\n- Tapping fingers repeatedly\nA vestibular stim is a behavior linked to a person\u2019s sense of balance and movement. It may include:\n- Rocking back and forth or side to side\n- Twirling or spinning\n- Jumping repeatedly\n- Hanging upside down\nOlfactory stimming centers around a person\u2019s sense of taste and smell. It includes repetitive behaviors such as:\n- Smelling objects\n- Tasting unusual objects\n- Licking hand or objects\nIn most cases, stimming is not harmful and does not need to be stopped or suppressed. Karen Wang, author of the book My Baby Rides the Short Bus: The Unabashedly Human Experience of Raising Kids With Disabilities , believes that any stim eliminated by a caregiver is likely to be replaced with a new one.\nDespite this, some parents might want to reduce a particular stimming behavior to avoid self injury or help maintain a level of social acceptability . For example, a caregiver might use an autism helmet to prevent a child from injuring him/herself when head banging.\nIf you are concerned for your child\u2019s safety, here are some more ideas for reducing stimming behaviors.\nSome medical conditions like ear infections, migraines, and physical pain can worsen stimming behaviors in autistic people, so it\u2019s important to have this checked and addressed as soon as possible. It can be particularly hard to tell if a medical issue is present if your child is non-verbal, so it\u2019s worth visiting your doctor regularly. If a medical condition is the reason for the stimming, it could reduce or stop completely with treatment and support.\nStudies have shown physical activities can release tension and reduce stimming in people with autism. Engaging autistic people to exercise for a few minutes every day might help stop stimming to some extent.\nEnsure your home is a safe, quiet space in order to prevent stress and anxiety (which can often cause stimming). Your child\u2019s home should be a place where most outside factors that trigger stimming are avoided, creating the best possible environment for the child.\nThe use of a stimming behavior can be offered as a reward after a challenging activity. This might sound strange, but adopting this strategy means the child with autism has the freedom to express him/herself in a way that he/she chooses (and he/she might stim less throughout the rest of the day) ( Moore, 2008 ).\nWhile there are many approaches parents and caregivers can take to help manage a child\u2019s stims, the most effective might be to work towards instilling self-regulation. It is widely believed that stimming can reduce when a child learns to manage his/her emotions.\nShare:"], "citation_links": ["https://certifiedautismcenter.com/2021/10/12/autism-stimming-and-hand-flapping-what-are-the-key-causes-and-behaviors/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_1cd66976-63ef-48c0-b27a-1d85345f5167"}

Dallas joined the NFL in 1960 as an expansion team under head coach Tom Landry. They were off to a rough start as they had losing seasons through the first five years. But once they started gaining some traction, they were unstoppable.\nSuper Bowl V: 1971, vs Baltimore Colts (loss) 11 years after joining the NFL, in 1971, the Cowboys made their first Super Bowl appearance against the Baltimore (now Indianapolis) Colts. The Cowboys lost with a score of 16-13 with the last Colts field goal winning it with five seconds left in the game. Strangely enough, though the Cowboys lost, it was a member of their team, Chuck Howley, who won the Most Valuable Player Award. He, a linebacker, was also the first player to win the award who wasn\u2019t a quarterback.\nSuper Bowl VI: 1972, vs Miami Dolphins (win) One year later, in 1972, the Cowboys saw their first Super Bowl victory. They played the Miami Dolphins and held them to 185 yards and not a single touchdown in an epic 24-3 defeat. Meanwhile, the Cowboys had a record of 252 rushing yards. This was the era of Roger Staubach , Chuck Howley , and Duane Thomas .\nSuper Bowl X: 1976, vs Pittsburgh Steelers (loss) The Cowboys lost this one 21-17 to the Steelers, who were the first team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowls. The Steelers were losing by 3 in the final quarter but rallied to score 14 more points with Dallas scoring only one more touchdown late in the game.\nSuper Bowl XII: 1978, vs Denver Broncos (win) This particular Super Bowl was the most-watched of all Cowboys Super Bowls with over 100 million fans watching both at home and in front of a sold-out stadium. Perhaps this was due to it being the first Super Bowl to ever be played in prime time in the Eastern US, or perhaps it was just because Staubach and company were so fun to watch. It was a defense-dominant Cowboys team that forced eight turnovers and allowed only eight pass completions and 61 yards to the Broncos that helped the Cowboys to the 27-10 victory over the Denver Broncos.\nSuper Bowl XIII: 1979, vs Pittsburgh Steelers (loss) This was an exciting Super Bowl for a few reasons. The Cowboys had an opportunity for a rematch after losing to the Steelers three years earlier, and both teams were looking to be the first to win a third Super Bowl. It was also the only Super Bowl that featured both teams which had won two Super Bowls in that same decade. In the end, the Cowboys lost in a close game, 35-31. There were 11 players on that Cowboys team who ended up in the Hall of Fame.\nSuper Bowl XXVII: 1993, vs Buffalo Bills (win) Here is where we get to the huge win-streak. The 90s were a big time for the Dallas Cowboys. This game in particular was the biggest win the Cowboys ever had, with a 52-17 defeat over the Bills. We saw four touchdown passes from Troy Aikman and 108 rushing yards by Emmitt Smith and this Cowboys team just made it look like a walk in the park.\nSuper Bowl XXVVIII: 1994, vs Buffalo Bills (win) The Cowboys and Bills rematch just one year later ended with a second consecutive Super Bowl victory for the Boys, 30-13 over the Bills. Again, the Cowboys just waltzed in and danced around the Bills, with Emmitt Smith rushing for 132 yards and two touchdowns.\nSuper Bowl XXX: 1996, vs Pittsburgh Steelers (win) Things were heating up for the Cowboys in this decade. They took an early lead over the Steelers with Troy Aikman , J ay Novacek , and Chris Boniol helping to gain an early 13 to zip lead. Hall of Famers Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin could not be stopped and in the end, the Cowboys finally got their victory revenge over the Steelers, 27 to 17.\nWho knew that would be the last time we\u2019d see a Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl for over two decades? Yet, fans still believe they will get there again, and soon.\nAmerica\u2019s Team is looking more like Super Bowl contenders than they have in a while. Good enough for a Super Bowl run?

Cleaning your iPad is very simple, but you need to make sure you're using the proper cleaning products to avoid removing protective coatings. We'll walk you through what to use as an Apple iPad screen cleaner (along with what not to use) and then cover how to clean and disinfect your iPad.\nFun fact: Your iPad has an oleophobic (oil-repellant) coating on the screen. This protects the touch screen on your device from the oils naturally found on your fingertips. While it is normal for this coating to diminish over time with normal usage, using cleaning products with certain ingredients will actually remove this protective coating along with your germs! Because of this, it is important to make sure that your cleaning materials follow the criteria below.\nIf you're a big fan of the iPad and you're ready to actually spring for a new one, but are torn between purchasing the new iPad Air or the iPad Pro, read through our article that hashes out the details to help you better decide.\nDiscover your iPhone\u2019s hidden features\nGet one daily tip each day (with screenshots and clear instructions) so you can master your iPhone in just one minute a day.\nThe following products are recommended by Apple Support to clean and disinfect your iPad:\n- 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe\n- 75% ethyl alcohol wipe\n- Clorox Disinfecting Wipes\n- Lint-free cloth (such as a lens cloth)\n- Products containing bleach or hydrogen peroxide\n- Window cleaners, household cleaners, or aerosol sprays\n- Compressed air\n- Abrasive materials (such as paper towels, toilet paper, or other materials with harsh fibers like wood pulp)\nFor more helpful information on how to care for your Apple devices, be sure to sign up for our free Tip of the Day . Now that you're equipped with the proper cleaning materials, let's cover the best way to clean your iPad screen and its exterior surfaces.\n- Remove your iPad from its case.\n- Unplug all cables and turn your iPad off.\n- Use a dry microfiber or other lint-free cloth to wipe your iPad down.\n- Once your iPad is clear of all obvious detritus, use one of the Apple-recommended iPad screen wipes to disinfect your iPad.\n- Avoid any ports, openings, or micro-iPad mesh on your iPad.\n- Wipe your iPad gently. Rubbing on it too harshly may damage the oil-repellent finish.\n- If you are using a screen protector, pay special attention to the areas where the protector adheres to your device\u2019s screen, as those little cracks can be great places for germs to hang out.\nNote: Never submerge your iPad in water or any cleaning product (even if you have a water-resistant model).\nOnce you've complete the steps above, you'll have a sparkling tablet sans fingerprints, germs, dirt, and dust. To really get your iPad clean, you should also consider learning how to clean your iPad charging port .\nYou should never use cleaning products on leather or fabric iPad cases, as these will discolor and otherwise damage them. Instead, follow the steps below to clean your iPad case. Since leather and fabric cases are harder to disinfect, you may want to consider switching to a hard, plastic case if sanitizing your case is a priority.\n- Remove your iPad from the case.\n- Gently clean the case with a cloth wetted with soapy water and let it dry.\n- Remove your iPad from the case.\n- Wipe all surfaces of your plastic case with a disinfecting wipe or cloth dipped in 70-percent isopropyl alcohol.\nAfter following these steps, you can enjoy some peace of mind and a sparkling clean iPad.

In a short time, T20 became the most popular and lucrative form of cricket, particularly in India, where huge crowds attend matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and millions more watch on television. A shortened form of cricket known as Cricket Max was developed in New Zealand in the 1990s by the former Test batsman Martin Crowe, but the official rules for T20 were established by the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the first tournament was played by the English county teams, in 2003.\nThe format was quickly adopted by other countries, and two years later Australia and New Zealand played each other in a lighthearted T20 match in Auckland, the first official international T20 match. Both sides wore uniforms from the 1980s and wore (mostly fake) moustaches. It quickly became apparent, though, that T20 had the potential to attract a new, vibrant, young audience to cricket. The first T20 World Cup, played in South Africa in 2007, was won by India, creating a huge market for T20 on the subcontinent that was quickly exploited by the IPL. Subsequent World Cups were played in various cricket-playing countries, with the West Indies capturing the most titles (two). Each major cricketing country developed its own domestic T20 tournaments, and a Champions League competition between the best club sides\u2014like that contested in European football (soccer)\u2014is held at the end of each T20 season.\nWith its cheerleaders, loud music, and quick-fire entertainment, T20 was credited with reviving cricket in the 21st century. After initial doubts, players began to master the new skills demanded by T20 and to improve their fielding, throwing, and fitness. Traditional cricket followers, however, feared that inevitably T20 would threaten the future of Test cricket, regarded as the purest and most intricate form of the game."], "citation_links": ["https://www.britannica.com/sports/Cricket-World-Cup"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_5663e1d9-06fe-4ab3-9998-abe81c482791"}

In the last decade alone roughly a billion cases have gone through the state judicial system.\nA first-of-its-kind database of more than 10,000 current state judges shows when it comes to race, gender and ethnicity, these courts are not representative of the people they serve.\n\u201c[rquote]We need a judiciary that reflects the population and we do not have it right now[/rquote],\u201d said database co-creator and study co-author Tracey George , a professor of law and political science at Vanderbilt University.\n\u201cA state court judge has tremendous power and discretion in resolving cases and there is limited oversight of the work they do. A state court judge is not only the most significant person resolving thousands of legal disputes that directly impact every day Americans, they are often the only person. They are the last word in most cases.\u201d\nThe co-authors believe a truly representative judiciary would have a fair representation of women and minorities on the bench as it does in the population.\n\u201cOur legal system is premised on the idea that judges can understand the circumstances of the community they serve. If we can\u2019t meet that presumption, then we may need to reevaluate the role of courts in our society,\u201d the co-authors write.\nThe study, \u201c The Gavel Gap: Who Sits in Judgement on State Courts?\u201d was written by George and Albert H. Yoon, professor of law and economics at the University of Toronto with support from the American Constitution Society .\nMore than half of state trial judges and state appellate judges are white men. White men are the most overrepresented group at nearly double their relative numbers compared to the U.S. population.\nWomen are grossly underrepresented on state courts. Women are roughly half of the population and half of enrolled law students. But less than one-third of state judges are women. In some states, women are underrepresented by a ratio of one to four. Not a single state has a representative number of female judges to women in that state.\nPeople of color make up roughly four in ten people in the country, but fewer than two in ten judges are a racial or ethnic minority. The story is one of sharp contrasts. In the five best states (considered most representative between judges and residents), minorities are represented at roughly the same rate on state courts as in the general population. But in the five worst, minorities are nearly absent from the judiciary.\nWomen of color are the most underrepresented group in state courts with only 8 percent of national representation on state trial an appellate courts compared to 40 percent of their relative numbers in the general population.\nThe authors ranked each state assigning overall grades that combined the representation of females and minorities on state courts in comparison to the percentage of the population. Forty-one states had a \u201cD\u201d or \u201cF.\u201d This means these states had 69 percent or less parity between women or minorities on the state court bench compared to the representative population. State with an \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d had 80 percent or better parity.\n- Twenty-seven states received a failing grade, meaning these states have less than 60 percent parity between women on the state court bench compared to women in the population.\n- Worst states in order of rank: West Virginia, Idaho, Mississippi, Utah, Kansas\n- Zero states received an excellent grade, meaning not a single state had a representative number of female judges compared to the number of women in that state.\n- Best states in order of rank: Oregon, Nevada, Washington, D.C., New Mexico, Minnesota\n- Thirty-two states received a failing grade, meaning less than 60 percent of the judges were a racial or ethnic representation of the population.\n- Worst states in order of rank: New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, North Dakota, Alaska\n- Seven states received an excellent score. At least 90 percent of their state judges were racially or ethnically representative of the population.\n- Best states: Montana, South Dakota, West Virginia, Hawaii, Wyoming, Nebraska\n\u201cMany of the states that fared poorly on the gender score also performed badly on the ethnic representation,\u201d said the researchers.\nState court judicial decisions in civil and criminal cases create precedent, interpret law and even make law. George says arguably the indirect consequences of a state court judge\u2019s decisions can be even more significant.\nShe cites the June 2016 Stanford rape trial as a perfect example.\n\u201cWhen a state court judge decides one case, it affects disputes in any way related to that case. So in the case of the Stanford swimmer convicted of sexual assault, a state court judge, who was also a Stanford graduate and a former athlete at Stanford, decided the student should not receive the standard two-year penalty set by the state legislature in California as the minimum sentence for that crime, \u201d George said. \u201cInstead he gave him no prison time and six months in jail. Not only did the judge decide that dispute, affecting the victim and the defendant, it also means by implication that anytime someone who is convicted of sexual assault is a college student, they don\u2019t merit the statutory sentence. So that single sexual assault case has implications for every other sexual assault case on every college campus under that court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d\nThe researchers hope this database will help inform the current method of identifying and selecting judges to make the selections more representative of the areas they serve. And they want this to lead to a pipeline of women and minorities to serve as judges.\n\u201c[rquote]We need diversity in race and gender because it brings to the bench all the experiences of the citizens whom those judges serve[/rquote],\u201d said George.\nThey are also hoping that in states where judges are elected, more women and minorities will run for a judgeship and more voters will be encouraged to elect them.\nThe next phase of George and Yoon\u2019s research will examine the legal decisions of the judges in this massive database to see if there are signs of influence connected to race, gender and ethnicity."], "citation_links": ["https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2016/06/22/massive-database-shows-state-judges-are-not-representative-of-the-people-they-serve/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_f1db4c85-268f-4a6e-b0bf-e93083cdd0c4"}

There are plans to make outdoor caf\u00e9 culture a permanent fixture of Britain's streets.", "references": ["- Published\nBy Duncan Smith\nBBC News Online\nOn the UK's high streets it's survival of the fittest. Yet, in the age of the double-shot, low-fat, no-foam latte, the traditional cafe - or \"caff\" - lives on.\nWith their prescriptive queuing rules and confusing names for small, medium and large cup sizes, the chain coffee shops seem to be accepted as the place to go for a caffeinated pick-me-up and a bite to eat.\nThe identikit decor and handy loyalty card stamps pull us in and keep us coming back - but also leave some people cold.\nFor Seb Emina, author of the London Review of Breakfasts blog , nothing less than what is sometimes affectionately known as a \"greasy spoon\" will do.\nThe River Cafe in Putney, south-west London, has been run by the same family for 36 years\nWe're talking glass sugar dispensers with red and brown sauce bottles on laminate tables, jets of steam rising from industrial looking chrome tea machines and menus that cater for your every culinary need - from a fruit juice to a full roast, a fry-up to an apple crumble and custard.\n\"It's not just the food - in fact that is almost secondary to the general atmosphere,\" says Mr Emina. \"I'd rather have fluorescent strip lights and hand-written menus.\n\"It's also a sense of history in some of them. They feel like they have been around a long time and they are friendly but not over familiar.\"\nOne example is E. Pellicci - which has been serving up British and Italian fare to the folk of Bethnal Green, east London, since 1900.\nInside the bustling cafe, history is evident all around. The wood panelled walls feature Pellicci family photos dating back to the founder herself, Elide Pellicci.\nThe late Nevio Pellicci, son of the founder, ran the cafe through much of the 20th Century and into the 21st. His death six years ago, at the age of 82, means the future of the cafe is now in the hands of his children, Anna and Nevio.\nFor Ms Sereno, coming to work each day is a joy. \"I feel like I've won the lottery really, I do work every day but I love doing it. People come in and they almost feel like I am part of their extended family. It's lovely, it's never a chore.\"\nBusiness appears to be booming, with customers often queuing out the door.\nSo what - beyond the general atmosphere - draws customers back to traditional cafes?\nDenise Clarke, co-owner of Mary's Kitchen cafe in Nottingham, believes fresh produce is the key to the British cafe's continued success.\n\"People know that they are going to get fresh food,\" she explained. \"It's not loaded down with salts and things and it is homemade. We make homemade cakes which go down very well and we serve all day breakfasts.\"\nDespite a downturn in trade over the past three years, Ms Clarke now reports customer numbers are increasing. And while Mary's Kitchen might not have an extensive list of avant garde coffees to chose from, that doesn't bother customers.\n\"We use a good brand of teabag which a lot of cafes don't bother with. We do serve a lot of bus drivers and they prefer tea to coffee.\"\nImage source,\nEmma Lynch/BBC\nHomemade food keeps some people coming back for more, but for others, it's the price.\n\"We've got regulars that have been coming 38 years,\" said George Nicholaides, owner of The Olympic in Leeds. \"But we also attract a lot of old and homeless people. Nothing is bought in and we use good quality stuff.\n\"The food is very good, it's all homemade and it's cheap.\"\nPart of their longevity is also down to savvy business sense. Mr Nicholaides bought the building when it came up for sale years ago, thus removing the burden of making enough money to pay high city centre rents.\n\"In the 1980s we were very busy. We had all the regulars come in and they brought their families and there were cafes all up and down [the street],\" he said.\n\"But they closed when McDonalds and Starbucks and the chicken shops came in and because rents and rates have gone up. We keep going though.\"\nImage source,\nLauren Potts / BBC\nOther independent cafes report that service with a smile is one way to keep customers parting with their pennies.\nDorino Tabrizi runs Alpino's in Islington, north London, which has been filling the bellies of hungry Londoners since 1948.\nMr Tabrizi has been in charge for eight years, although he has been in the trade for a lot longer than that. For many years he ran a successful restaurant in north London and now brings the same exacting standards to running his cafe.\n\"The food is the main thing, and the service,\" he says. \"I pay people to serve the customers properly seven days a week.\"\nFrank Barone - of Gino's in central London - thinks that philosophy is the key.\n\"You have to be nice to the customer,\" he says. \"The food must be fresh, you must be fast and you have to give good value for money. And a big smile - that's my secret.\"\nService with a smile - Dorino Tabrizi runs the ever-popular Alpino's in London\n- Grizzly's Caf\u00e9 Truck Stop, Biggleswade, Bedfordshire\n- Mulberrys Cafe, St. Albans, Hertfordshire\n- Markham Moor Truckstop, Retford, Nottinghamshire\n- The Market Diner, Brighton\n- The Bus Stop Cafe, Southampton\nDave Fry, author of I Fancy A Fryup , has dedicated much of his time to seeking out the finest examples of traditional British cafes.\n\"They are not really greasy spoons these day, a lot of the food is grilled,\" he says. \"But if something was advertised as a greasy spoon that would be my first choice of place to visit. I like the image of a couple making the breakfast from scratch in their kitchen.\n\"I don't know why people go to chain coffee shops. Is it fashion?\"\nMr Fry predicts a change in the taste of the British people - as they seek a more individual, homemade dining experience. He is currently working on an app to guide people to the best cafes.\n\"There is a comeback for cafes - there was a dip for a while with a few closing but I think it's getting better, you see more opening and people are more reasonable about healthy eating now.\"\nImage source,\nLauren Potts / BBC\nThe Greedy Pig in Leeds was once the greasy spoon of choice for students and businesses in nearby North Street.\nBut its current owners have distanced themselves from its previous image and while a cooked breakfast is still at the menu's core, it has branched out to serving food which appeals to a wider range of customers.\n\"It was a conscious decision,\" said owner Joanna Myers. \"We didn't change the name because it's so well known and we still have people who have been coming since the 1980s.\n\"But there's a limit to how much people will pay for a bacon sandwich and there comes a point where you have to look at the rents and rates.\"\nThe Greedy Pig may have changed tack, but the greasy spoon is still a pillar of city cuisine.\nAs Mr Emina, of the London Review of Breakfasts, puts it: \"I see no evidence of the greasy spoons going anywhere. They hold a special place in people's hearts. For a lot of us there are times when only a greasy spoon will do.\"\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Potts."], "citation_links": ["https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-30879406"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_0bb02d11-e95f-489f-8e6d-aca70fdae9ae"}

Light zips through interstellar space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second and 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers) per year.\nWe use light-time to measure the vast distances of space.\nIt\u2019s the distance that light travels in a specific period of time. Also: LIGHT IS FAST, nothing travels faster than light.\nHow far can light travel in one minute? 11,160,000 miles. It takes 43.2 minutes for sunlight to reach Jupiter, about 484 million miles away. Light is fast, but the distances are vast . In an hour, light can travel 671 million miles.\nEarth is about eight light minutes from the Sun. A trip at light-speed to the very edge of our solar system \u2013 the farthest reaches of the Oort Cloud, a collection of dormant comets way, way out there \u2013 would take about 1.87 years. Keep going to Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighboring star, and plan on arriving in 4.25 years at light speed.\nWhen we talk about the enormity of the cosmos, it\u2019s easy to toss out big numbers \u2013 but far more difficult to wrap our minds around just how large, how far, and how numerous celestial bodies really are.\nTo get a better sense, for instance, of the true distances to exoplanets \u2013 planets around other stars \u2013 we might start with the theater in which we find them, the Milky Way galaxy\nOur galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars, swirling in a spiral through space. Based on the deepest images obtained so far, it\u2019s one of about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. Groups of them are bound into clusters of galaxies, and these into superclusters; the superclusters are arranged in immense sheets stretching across the universe, interspersed with dark voids and lending the whole a kind of spiderweb structure. Our galaxy probably contains 100 to 400 billion stars, and is about 100,000 light-years across. That sounds huge, and it is, at least until we start comparing it to other galaxies. Our neighboring Andromeda galaxy, for example, is some 220,000 light-years wide. Another galaxy, IC 1101, spans as much as 4 million light-years.\nBased on observations by NASA\u2019s Kepler Space Telescope, we can confidently predict that every star you see in the sky probably hosts at least one planet. Realistically, we\u2019re most likely talking about multi-planet systems rather than just single planets. In our galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars, this pushes the number of planets potentially into the trillions. Confirmed exoplanet detections (made by Kepler and other telescopes, both in space and on the ground) now come to more than 4,000 \u2013 and that\u2019s from looking at only tiny slices of our galaxy. Many of these are small, rocky worlds that might be at the right temperature for liquid water to pool on their surfaces.\nThe nearest-known exoplanet is a small, probably rocky planet orbiting Proxima Centauri \u2013 the next star over from Earth. A little more than four light-years away, or 24 trillion miles. If an airline offered a flight there by jet, it would take 5 million years. Not much is known about this world; its close orbit and the periodic flaring of its star lower its chances of being habitable.\nThe TRAPPIST-1 system is seven planets, all roughly in Earth\u2019s size range, orbiting a red dwarf star about 40 light-years away. They are very likely rocky, with four in the \u201chabitable zone\u201d \u2013 the orbital distance allowing potential liquid water on the surface. And computer modeling shows some have a good chance of being watery \u2013 or icy \u2013 worlds. In the next few years, we might learn whether they have atmospheres or oceans, or even signs of habitability.\nOne of the most distant exoplanets known to us in the Milky Way is Kepler-443b.

Is it difficult for you to get your point across that the rules in your class are not negotiable?\nDon\u2019t worry, you are not alone! Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. You can have effective classroom rules that will benefit your students and yourself! Coming up with classroom rules can be a challenging task, but we have all the tips and tricks you need to make it easier.\nWell, there are many reasons why you should have classroom rules. Here are just a few:\nSplashLearn inspires lifelong curiosity with its game-based PreK-5 learning program loved by over 40 million children. With over 4,000 fun games and activities, it\u2019s the perfect balance of learning and play for your little one.\nEstablishing rules in your class will create an environment of respect where students know what to expect from you and vice versa. It creates boundaries and clarifies that the classroom is not a place for anarchy or chaos. You can limit rule-breakers by enforcing consequences as outlined in the rules.\nEverybody likes to be in control of their day. It is not only helpful for you but also for your students when they know what comes next. You can easily plan out a class period, considering all activities you have prepared and how long each one will take. An overview of the period will help keep your students on track and increase their engagement in what is being taught.\nClassroom rules are a great way to manage behavior issues in class. They put all students on the same page, so they know what is expected and can adjust accordingly. If there are consequences for not following the rules, students are less likely to act out in class.\nYou will see your students more engaged when they know what is expected of them. They will not be wandering around or looking for direction on how to spend their study time. Having class rules makes it easier for you to manage your period efficiently and accomplish what you came in to do.\nNow that you know the benefits of having classroom rules let\u2019s look at some of them. We have compiled a list of 30 basic rules for your consideration. If any of these are not appropriate for your students, feel free to modify them as needed. Here they are:\n1. Arrive on time for class.\n2. Raise your hand to speak or volunteer.\n3. Follow the dress code of the school.\n4. Do not cheat or copy other people\u2019s work.\n5. Complete all assignments.\n6. Listen to the teacher when being spoken to and answer your question.\n7. Respect everyone in the class.\n8. Keep your hands, feet, and objects to yourself.\n9. Respect the school property.\n10. Keep your language clean and appropriate for the classroom setting.\n11. Do not leave your seat without permission.\n12. Do not eat or drink in class (except for water).\n13. Learn at least one thing you did not know before coming to class.\n14. Ask for help if you do not understand something the teacher just said, and be respectful while asking for it.\n15. Be on time for every assignment or test (except for medical or other emergencies).\n16. Do your best work each day, regardless of how much time is left in class.\n17. Never give up on yourself or your goals.\n18. Be open to new ideas and change with an open mind!\n19. Treat others the way you want to be treated, with kindness and respect.\n21. Be a friend to everyone in the classroom and keep your friendships strong.\n22. Listen to what the teacher says and follow directions carefully.\n23. Apologize if you make a mistake or accidentally hurt someone else.\n24. Tell the truth!\n25. Raise your hand if you have a question and wait to be called on.\n26. No one should ever be made to feel bad about who they are.\n27. Respect each other\u2019s ideas and opinions even if you disagree with them.\n28. Take pride in your work and hand it in on time.\n29. Do not let anyone influence you to do anything you know is wrong.\n30. Always try your best. Never give up!\nAnd there you have it, 30 classroom rules that are sure to keep your students engaged and productive in class! You may find that some of the rules apply only to specific subjects or grade levels. Feel free to modify/delete the rules that do not apply in your classroom. Now let\u2019s learn how to create your own set of rules that work best for you and your students.\nNow that we\u2019ve covered why class rules are essential, let\u2019s talk about how to create them. There is no one-size-fits-all approach; depending on your teaching style and what you want to accomplish in class, they can be either strict or flexible.\nThere is such a thing as too strict. And if you already have behavior issues in your classroom, no rule will help you unless you make significant changes to how your students perceive and understand the purpose of the rules. Depending on what kind of class this is, it can be challenging to have suitable rules for every student. Sometimes the number of pros does not outweigh the number of cons.\nHaving flexible class rules will make your students want to take advantage of them. And if you do not respect them yourself, they might not be very effective. It can create a hostile environment in your classroom when the rules are not taken seriously by you or your students.\nTo establish rules that work for everyone, it is best to know what kind of class this is and how strict you need them to be. Everyone adheres to different expectations, so do not force yourself into a specific model. If you do not want to have a rigid list of rules, that is perfectly fine. You can still have a positive class culture by being flexible with the guidelines and focusing more on students\u2019 behavior rather than their actions.\nHere are some simple steps you can take to get started:\nBefore anything else, you need to decide what words you will use when talking about the rules. Your students need to know that these are not just guidelines but actual expectations they have to abide by. You can refer to them as your \u201cclassroom guidelines\u201d or \u201cclassroom policies.\u201d Regardless of what words you choose, make sure that your students are aware of what these are.\nThe next step is to make them clear, especially if you are coming up with a list of more than one rule. Use words that are easy to understand, so students do not get confused or misinterpret rules on their own. You can also create a presentation or handout with examples of the rules in specific situations so students know how to react. Use Splashlearn\nAfter setting up your list of rules, communicate them to your students clearly and often. Keep a copy of them where all of your students can see and post reminders around the classroom that they can refer to. When it comes to class rules, repetition is vital when it comes to reinforcing them with your students.\nBased on their effectiveness, you will learn what works well in your classroom and what does not. Make changes to improve them along the way instead of waiting until the end of the semester or school year. You can also adapt or adjust them according to feedback from your students, so they are more comfortable with them.\nHaving too many rules can have the opposite effect, so it is best to keep it simple. If you have trouble coming up with enough rules, focus more on behaviors instead of actions. For example, if a student does not follow nonverbal cues like raising their hand or staying quiet during class discussions, that is the behavior that needs to be addressed.\nInstead of worrying about your class rules, focus on how you will deal with breaking them. There are many ways to address poor behavior and discipline students accordingly, so do not get stuck on the number of rules you have for them in particular. They need to know that the rules are not there to make their lives more complicated but to help them succeed in class and beyond.\nYour students will notice if you are using exactly the same set of rules with other classes or teachers, so it is best to make them personal to your own teaching philosophy. You can always start with a list of rules from another teacher to use as a base, but make them your own by adding or removing certain ones along the way.\nMake sure that they are easily accessible and available for your students so they can refer to them when necessary. Having physical copies in several places like on the front or blackboard, at their desks, or in a binder will make them easily accessible.\nRemember to keep things balanced by not letting the rules become too much of a focus for your students during class time. It is equally essential to provide positive praise when they are following through with necessary actions or behaving well.\nSome teachers like to start with rules during the first few days of class, but others prefer to wait until later on when their students are more comfortable with things. You can even use them right away if you know your students will be different and need an adjustment period. It all depends on how well they work for your specific students.\nThink about what sort of rules will be the most helpful for your class and their needs. They should be age-appropriate, so if you are teaching elementary school students, then using complex phrases or words that might go over their heads is not recommended. When in doubt, picking ones that are familiar to them, like \u201craise your hand before speaking\u201d or \u201ccome to class prepared for lecture,\u201d will be helpful.\nMany teachers wonder how exactly they should keep their students in line when it comes to following classroom rules, so here are some effective methods.\nWhen students violate the classroom rules, you should address them by giving them a consequence appropriate for their actions. If they did not follow one of your rules, just explain why and what the rule is in general, so they understand it better.\nTeachers who use positive reinforcement with their students find that the students do not need as many consequences because they are already doing well! Make sure to compliment good behavior when you see it or hear about it, but avoid saying negative things about bad behavior since that might make them think acting out is okay.\nYou can even give tokens throughout the day to those who behave well, which will turn into credits at the end and can be used for special privileges like a student of the day, going to recess early, or choosing their own seat.\nThe key to being effective with classroom rules is to have a system that works for you and your students, so be sure to track their performance during the school year. You can use SplashLearn to get insights into how your students are performing as a whole as well as individual students so you can understand where they need the most work.\nIt is imperative that you are consistent with enforcing your rules and rewarding good behavior if you want them both to work well within your students\u2019 lives at school! Ensure that you follow through with all punishments and rewards that you set forth, or else they will not encourage compliance.\nFrom day one, it is important to maintain a positive classroom environment where your students feel safe and comfortable, so they do not want to act out as much as possible. Once you have established this type of classroom, you will see that most problems can be solved without needing consequences because they will be minimal in the first place.\nRemember that it takes a lot of time and patience to get through this process, so do not get frustrated if there are still problems from time to time. Talk with your students about the rules before starting class and have them help you develop ways for problem-solving. By keeping the lines of communication open, you will be able to resolve issues as they happen, so you do not need to punish anyone.\nTeachers who use classroom management software like SplashLearn find that it helps them to be more effective with their students. The platform offers comprehensive grading and attendance tracking, so you can continuously monitor how your students are doing throughout the school year, in addition to having access to helpful resources for student achievement.\nUnfortunately, even the best classroom rules and students can lead to accidents. Because of this, you must have a plan for how your class will handle emergencies before they happen, so you are ready if anything happens. The more prepared you are ahead of time, the more effective you will be during an emergency.\nThe list of classroom rules to have will be endless, but here are 30 basic ones that will help you start creating your own or refining the ones you already have.\nFrom simple things like \u201craise your hand before speaking\u201d and \u201ccome to class prepared for the lecture\u201d all the way up to more complex concepts such as teaching students how their brain works so, they can process information better and achieve higher levels of success in school.\nIt may seem daunting at first, but once you start applying these principles, it\u2019s easy to see why teachers who use them find themselves less stressed out overall! Let us know if you can think of any we missed, and we might add them to the list!\nKids are easy to please, and science proves it! So many factors come into play when making rules meaningful to students. We suggest that you allow the students to have a part in making the rules. When that happens, everyone feels as if they have a stake in what is happening and that things are fair for all. In addition, they will feel as if their opinion is heard and valued by you as an educator.\nTeachers must have credibility within their classrooms. If you are the teacher, then it is your goal to gain your students\u2019 trust so that they listen to you when you need them to. There are several ways for you to do this. First, create a classroom culture where your students know that what you say goes and will be enforced. Second, never say something that you don\u2019t mean. If you do, your students will quickly learn to ignore you when needed. Lastly, make sure to follow through with the consequences you make known ahead of time!\nWe all know that too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth. The same is true when it comes to classroom rules. Teachers who can get their student\u2019s attention quickly without saying too much usually have fewer rules. However, this might not fit every type of level or age of the student. In addition, teachers should consider what their school expects from them regarding rules. In the end, no one can say for sure how many rules you should have in your classroom. It is best to consider all of the above and then create a list that works for you!\nThat all depends on what you are trying to accomplish as a teacher. For example, some teachers might say that their most important rule is \u201craise your hand before speaking.\u201d In our opinion, this would be beneficial for students who have trouble staying focused or might not know when it is their turn to speak in class. If you are working with students who have trouble keeping their focus, that might be one of your most important rules."], "citation_links": ["https://www.splashlearn.com/blog/best-classroom-rules-how-to-make-your-own-classroom-rules/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_6585bcf1-9a47-4e84-9f05-4c2c357bc829"}

It is important to balance privacy concerns with security needs.", "references": ["Everyone knows that workplace violence is a possibility regardless of industry \u2013 however, a number of recent studies point to the fact that this problem may be more severe than a lot of people likely realize. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , roughly two million American workers are the victim of workplace violence each year \u2013 and that number only includes the cases that are actually reported. As per a study from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted in 2014, a massive 409 people were fatally injured in work-related attacks and other incidents \u2013 a number making up roughly 16% of the 4,821 workplace deaths during that particular year. Helping employees recognize and report suspicious or threatening behavior looks like is an important first step for a workplace violence prevention program.\nIndeed, workplace violence has risen to become the third leading cause of death in a wide range of professions, including but not limited to healthcare workers, people working in education and media environments and those employed at law firms.\nWhile it\u2019s certainly true that technology and other physical security measures can go a long way towards creating the safest possible environment for everyone involved, your number one asset is and will always be your employees themselves. One of the best ways to help curb workplace violence is to teach people to both properly recognize and report threatening behavior that may be suspicious or otherwise threatening, stopping small problems now before they have a chance to become much bigger \u2013 and more dangerous \u2013 issues down the road.\nIf you really want to do your part to help employees recognize and report suspicious or threatening behavior, they must first understand just how broad these terms really are in this context.\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture handbook on Workplace Violence , Prevention and Response, the term \u201cworkplace violence\u201d can be used to describe \u201cany act of violence against persons or property, as well as threats, intimidation, harassment, or any other inappropriate, disruptive behavior that causes fear for personal safety in the workplace.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t a concept that is limited to just employee-on-employee violence, either. It can affect anyone \u2013 including third-party contractors who may be working in a business on a temporary basis, employees from another business who come by your location, visitors, and customers who come in and out of the business on a daily basis and more.\nThe USDA\u2019s handbook also outlines a number of situations that can potentially trigger or cause workplace violence. These include but are not limited to ones like:\n- Anger over the loss of a job or some other type of disciplinary action.\n- A resistance (or even a deeply rooted resentment) over regulatory actions, either by an employee or a customer.\n- A situation where a member of the public disagrees with the policy or practice of your business.\n- Violence based in intolerance or bigotry.\n- Actions intended to harm or intimidate someone because of their race, ethnicity, religion, country of origin or other personal characteristics and more.\nThese types of suspicious or threatening behavior situations can also come from anyone, anywhere at any time \u2013 be it an abusive employee or someone in a leadership position like a manager, a customer, a family member or even a total stranger.\nEducation is your number one asset in terms of helping employees create a safer, healthier and more productive environment \u2013 which means that the number one rule to effective threat management becomes making sure they themselves have all the information they need to make the right call at the right time.\nAccording to the experts at the Nonprofit Risk Management Center, one\u2019s ability to tell the difference between threats that amount to little more than venting, potentially dangerous situations that wind up being a hoax and threats that are absolutely to be taken seriously is \u201cpart experience, part intuition and part luck.\u201d\nThere ultimately isn\u2019t much that one can do to address luck \u2013 but as far as experience and intuition are concerned, those are totally under your control and the key to empowering these qualities within your own workforce begins and ends with the proper education.\nMany providers, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , not only offer free workplace violence prevention programs that you can use as an ongoing educational resource to empower your employees \u2013 oftentimes these programs can be targeted toward the specific industry that you\u2019re working in. Though there are some signs of violence or other suspicious and threatening behaviors that are universal, there are also threats specific to something like a healthcare environment that people working in a retail store wouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u2013 and vice versa.\nThis level of ongoing education can not only help employees better identify institutional, environmental and even policy-based risk factors for workplace violence, but they can also teach them to be better communicators and to use teamwork for ongoing threat assessments, they can help employees better identify resources to be used to support injured workers, they can help you create prevention strategies for particular departments or employees and more.\nAll of these types of resources should be deployed not only for existing employees, but they should also become a part of the employee onboarding process for new hires. Likewise, employees should be required to participate in these types of programs on a regular basis \u2013 at least once a year \u2013 to help them take advantage of new techniques, identify new threats and refresh their own knowledge of occupational safety prevention techniques and best practices.\nNot only should a workplace have a very clear zero-tolerance policy in place in terms of threats of physical violence, harassment, intimidation or other types of disruptive threatening behaviors, but that policy needs to be clearly communicated to all people. The policies must be enforced and the consequences must be severe \u2013 the stakes are far too high for any other \u201chalf measures\u201d approach.\nLikewise, it is essential for there to be systems and mechanisms in place that allow employees to quickly alert security personnel and/or emergency services to severe instances of suspicious or threatening behavior that point to the fact that an act of violence may be imminent. According to one recent study, 25% of surveyed businesses say that they are totally unprepared for an active shooter incident, for example. Simply having a system in place that allows employees to quickly act on the information they have or behaviors they\u2019ve observed will go a long way towards not only allowing them to use their experience and intuition as outlined above but potentially prevent a disaster of the highest order as well.\nAccording to the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals , one should also not be afraid to bring in outside help to help tackle employee awareness and prevention in these types of situations. Being aware of performance and or conduct issues that may seem small now, but that could also be warning signs of potential trouble, is the cornerstone of any prevention strategy. Taking the step to hire a workplace violence consultant or other security consultant therefore represents one of the best chances you have to do exactly that.\nWhen you\u2019re so focused on actually running a business, there are small things that could slip by your attention that could point to larger issues brewing just on the horizon. When you bring in outside assistance, these trends and patterns are more easily uncovered \u2013 putting you in a position to do something about them immediately.\nAccording to the Department of Labor , these types of performance and conduct indicators can include things like:\n- Attendance problems, including people taking excessive sick leave, excessive tardiness or certain improbably excuses for absences.\n- Concentration problems, including people who are easily distracted or who often have trouble recalling instructions.\n- Unusual and/or changed behaviors, including people who are suddenly prone to making inappropriate comments or throwing objects.\n- Evidence that develops pointing towards possible drug or serious alcohol use and abuse.\n- Evidence that develops pointing to serious stress in the personal life of one or more employees.\n- Low energy, a lack of enthusiasm or the presence of despair, all of which are major signs of unshakable depression.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the presence of any or even all of these qualities doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a violent act is imminent. It could just mean that someone is sick, depressed, is going through a lot of stress, etc. However, they\u2019re still critical things to watch out for within the larger context of prevention.\nBut regardless of the actual signs that are uncovered, the point of all this is overwhelmingly clear. If organizational leaders are in a better position to recognize these indicators through the help of someone like a security consultant, they can then more effectively communicate them to employees. Those employees then become more aware of the signs that they should be paying close attention to moving forward, which ultimately goes a long way towards an entire organization\u2019s ability to take a more proactive approach to combating workplace violence.\nIn the end, it\u2019s important to remember that your best chance to help create the safest possible working environment for everyone involved absolutely requires an \u201call hands on deck\u201d approach to what you\u2019re trying to accomplish. Security-conscious leadership will certainly go a long way and technological solutions like cameras, access control and others can help a great deal, but it is ultimately everyone\u2019s responsibility to not only be alert for the possibility that workplace violence might occur, but to also report those potential issues to people in a position to actually do something about them.\nUltimately, supervisors and other people in management positions are responsible for prevention, assessment, reporting and response. Therefore, the duty falls to every employee in a business to be alert and forward-thinking , providing those in higher positions with the actionable information they need to take immediate action should conditions escalate beyond what anyone is comfortable with.\nBryghtpath has developed the workplace violence prevention programs, threat management teams, and crisis plans for many Fortune 500 organizations.

However, his actions were controversial and he was responsible for many deaths. Despite this, he has become a generic symbol of the underdog, idealist, iconoclast, or martyr for many people around the world.", "references": ["The legacy of Che Guevara is a subject that, when discussed, often brings about contention. From a position anywhere to the right of left-wing politics, Che Guevara is a figure who is easy to dismiss as a less-than-savory character. In left-wing circles, however, arguments rage over many aspects of Che Guevara\u2019s life. To understand why this is, his life needs to be examined, and his actions need to be weighed.\nErnesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara was born in Argentina on June 14, 1928. The eldest of five children, his family was relatively well-off and had strong left-wing sympathies. His father, an ardent supporter of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War , often hosted Republican veterans from the war in his home.\nHe was also a proficient athlete who loved sports. In particular, was his love for rugby . He played flyhalf for Club Universitario de Buenos Aires and was known for his extremely aggressive style of play.\nSo from an early age, one can see that he was influenced by leftist ideals and had a penchant for aggression.\nSign up to our Free Weekly Newsletter\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t just his surroundings and his athleticism that defined his early life. Che was an intelligent human being who partook in many intellectual pursuits. At the age of 12, he started taking part in chess tournaments. At home, he spent much of his time engaged in books, reading a wide range of subjects, including politics, religion, ideology, philosophy, poetry, sociology, history, archeology, mathematics, and engineering. His interests seemed to have no limits.\nChe Guevara went on to study medicine and travel extensively through South America. During his travels, he came into contact with extreme poverty and the horrendous conditions in which many people lived. One incident that hugely affected his ideals was seeing a child unable to receive medical attention because of a lack of money. Situations like these made Guevara realize that he wanted to spend his life helping these people. He decided to leave medicine and enter the realm of politics, where he could address the foundation of the issues through armed struggle.\nThe Marxist struggle against capitalism and the imperial capitalism of the United States became hallmarks of his character. This opposition to capitalism is an essential factor in assessing the phenomenon of Che Guevara as an icon for the left insomuch as the modern world is concerned. Many people, especially younger generations in the west, have become disillusioned with capitalism, which they see as being in decline and ushering in an era of hopeless oligarchy. As such, people such as Che Guevara are given more thought, and their crimes are forgiven in the minds of those who are angry and struggling to make rent in the richest countries in the world.\nChe Guevara traveled via motorbike with his friend, Alberto Granada , and documented his travels. His notes were turned into a book and, subsequently, a movie, The Motorcycle Diaries (2004). Although only focusing on his early life before he became a revolutionary, the film adds to the heroic mystique of Guevara. It helped add to the sanitized version of the Che Guevara that exists as a symbol of the left.\nIn 1953, Che Guevara went to Guatemala to support the democratically elected government of Jacobo \u00c1rbenz . The government was enacting a series of reforms that sought to redistribute land ownership. Spurred by this development, the United States ramped up its attempt to remove \u00c1rbenz from power. It saturated the country with anti-\u00c1rbenz leaflets, armed anti-\u00c1rbenz guerillas, and began bombing runs in unmarked aircraft. The government was overthrown, and suspected communists were executed. This event cemented Guevara\u2019s hatred for US imperialism.\nIt was also during this time that Guevara was introduced to Cuban revolutionaries in exile, who would shape the path of his career. From Guatemala, he went on to work in Mexico, gaining further guerilla training. The next step in his career was the Cuban Revolution.\nThe Cuban Revolution was an extremely tough time for Che Guevara. The initial phase of the war saw much suffering, and 60 of the initial 82 revolutionaries were killed. After this, the guerilla movement spread in the rural areas of Cuba. Guevara became Fidel Castro\u2019s second in command and, although strict, was well-loved by the people with whom he had common interactions. This is partly due to the fact that Guevara facilitated the building of schools, workshops, ovens, and many other facilities to improve the lives of the rural populace (and to increase the size of the guerilla movement).\nIn the fighting that followed, Che proved to be an incredible tactician and won battles against insane odds. He was also noted as being extremely brave and even foolhardy, winning admiration from both his friends and his enemies.\nIn 1959, Guevara traveled extensively, visiting the countries of the Bandung Conference . He returned to Cuba, but by 1960, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro disputed ideological differences, and citing that his job to the Cuban Revolution was done, he left the island to continue revolutionary work throughout the rest of Latin America.\nFor the next seven years, he fought for regime change in several countries in Latin America and Africa. Still, the fights were brutal, and support was difficult to come by, as many peasants did not want to live the lifestyle of a communist guerrilla nor live in an area shaped by guerilla uprisings.\nIn 1967, Che Guevara, at the age of 39, was hunted down and captured in Bolivia. His captors executed him instead of letting him go to trial, knowing that since Bolivia had no death penalty, the worst he would get was life imprisonment. A lengthy trial would gain much unwanted attention from communist countries. As such, he died a hero\u2019s death, the perfect icon of a martyr prepped for world fame and reverence.\nImagery of Che Guevara is everywhere and has transcended the roles in which he was made famous. His image is a marketing tool and, in many cases, an accessible, easily-recognizable symbol of chic-ness that pervades the fashion scene, adorns walls, and appears in various forms of media. This imagery is seen as benevolent at best and benign at worst.\nThe commercialization of Che is subject to debate and controversy. While many have noted that commercialization is a natural capitalist process, it has also served to pacify the revolutionary character. Some academics have argued, however, that this could have a reverse effect in that the cost of living is getting higher, and younger generations are feeling increasingly disassociated with the success of capitalism. Without the commercialization of Che Guevara, many would not know who he was or for what he stood. Now, however, an angry generation of youths today has an icon that they can transform into a martyred hero who fought for things that the younger generations want and need.\nChe Guevara indeed had a harsh and brutal side. He presided over Fidel Castro\u2019s firing squads. Under Guevara\u2019s orders, 176 enemies of the revolution were executed, many of which were members of Batista \u2019s secret police. What is conveniently omitted in this argument is that at La Caba\u00f1a prison camp, over which Guevara presided, the main victims were members of the former Batista government and were guilty of brutal repression and murder themselves. It could be argued that the trials at La Caba\u00f1a were Cuba\u2019s Nuremberg Trials. However, it must be noted that the trials were neither lengthy nor exhaustive in the process of reaching the truth.\nGuevara is also claimed to have executed people without trial, as attested by a comment he made before his death:\n\u201cTo send men to the firing squad, judicial proof is unnecessary. These procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail.\u201d\nChe Guevara also created the idea of the \u201cnew man\u201d \u2013 an idealized image of the perfect revolutionary who was cooperative, selfless, and anti-capitalist. Anyone who strayed from this ideal was subject to persecution. It is also claimed that Guevara was a homophobe and is reported to have, along with Castro, viewed homosexuality as a \u201cbourgeois decadence.\u201d\nIt is also contended that Che was instrumental in creating labor camps, which would evolve into concentration camps , where people who didn\u2019t fit with the imagery of the Cuban Revolution would be sent. According to journalist Paul Berman, this included gay people, dissidents, and people with AIDS .\nDespite the actions of Che Guevara, what is clear is that much of the anti-Che sentiment is a product of those with anti-communist views, and he is attacked because he was a communist rather than his capacity as a war criminal. Che Guevara, like many communist revolutionaries and leaders, is a common scapegoat on which to pin atrocities, even by proxy. In this, Che is found guilty by association. Even in prominent publications, Che Guevara takes the blame for communist insurgencies and civil wars that have gripped the South American continent.\nIn commenting on the \u201ccult of Che,\u201d many historians, writers, and journalists have condemned the popularity of Che Guevara in modern times. His popularity has been blamed on \u201chis capacity to provoke empathy among the spoiled youth of the affluent West,\u201d argues conservative American author Mark Falcoff, while Irish journalist Sean O\u2019 Hagan remarked, \u201cif Che hadn\u2019t been born so good-looking, he wouldn\u2019t be a mythical revolutionary.\u201d\nThe image of what Che Guevara represents is varied. His life story is distorted by proponents of both sides of the political spectrum, and the veracity of claims on both sides is subject to massive debate.\nIn the face of individualism, Che remains contentious. Everybody has their own set of principles with different ideas of what is justified and what should be condemned. As such, there can never be an international consensus on what exactly Che Guevara represents. And perhaps there shouldn\u2019t be."], "citation_links": ["https://www.thecollector.com/che-guevara-freedom-fighter-or-myth/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_9b1b0f23-90d3-4b5a-83f5-484bf6660b91"}

Just eight out of 38 court of appeal judges and 21 out of 106 high court judges are women. The overall percentage of female judges across the courts is 25%. Of court judges who declared their ethnicity, only 5.9% gave their background as BME.

Change may be happening, but it isn\u2019t happening quickly enough.\nMeanwhile, the makeup of our judiciary remains woefully out of step with the population it exists to serve. As with the under-representation of women in politics, this is arguably one of the professions where diversity matters the most \u2013 its members need to understand, as well as reflect, the full range of the society for which they work.\nThe fact that only 29% of MPs are women (22% before the election) takes on particular significance when it becomes clear that recent cuts have hit women hardest, for instance. The Fawcett Society recently reported that a staggering 74% of the money saved from benefit and tax changes since 2010 has come directly from women\u2019s pockets. So, too, the under-representation of BME people within the judiciary should be cause for particular concern, given the fact that offenders from ethnic minorities are more likely than their white counterparts to be sentenced to prison for certain categories of crimes.\nAccording to an analysis of more than 1m court records carried out by the Guardian in 2011 , black offenders were 44% more likely than white offenders to be sentenced to prison for driving offences, 38% more likely to be imprisoned for public disorder or possession of a weapon, and 27% more likely to be imprisoned for drugs possession. Asian offenders were 41% more likely to be sent to prison for drugs offences than their white counterparts and 19% more likely to go to jail for shoplifting.\nA pale, stale, male-dominated legal system also throws up questions given the number of recent cases where members of the judiciary have seemed to suggest victims of rape and violence are partially responsible for their own assault. In February this year, a judge sentencing two men for raping an 18-year-old student said : \u201cYour victim was very unwise to allow herself to drink so much that she became so thoroughly inebriated.\u201d He then described her as \u201cextremely foolish\u201d, before adding: \u201cShe became so drunk that she was vulnerable and defenceless to your exploitation.\u201d\nThis judge\u2019s comments came in the same month as the barrister David Osborne wrote a blogpost entitled \u201cShe was gagging for it\u201d , in which he decried the \u201cpolitically driven agenda\u201d that \u201chas been thrust down the throats of court-users about the deplorably low percentage of rape allegations that lead to conviction\u201d. He added: \u201cIn my book, consent is consent, blind drunk or otherwise, and regret after the event cannot make it rape.\u201dThen, in April, a day after the body of murdered 21-year-old student Karen Buckley was discovered in Glasgow, a judge adjudicating on a different case (of 21-year-old Leanne Roberts assaulting a woman outside a bar) remarked: \u201cI find it incredible that young people can get so drunk that they don\u2019t even know who they\u2019re with. One only has to think about the horrible situation in Glasgow to see how serious this could have been. It\u2019s very, very worrying how young girls put themselves in such very, very vulnerable positions.\u201d His words came despite the fact that there was no suggestion that Miss Buckley was drunk on the night she died. In July, an Irish judge ruled that a man who regularly raped his heavily medicated girlfriend in her sleep over a period of almost a year should serve no jail time . Why? Because his crime would not have been discovered had he not confessed, saying: \u201cIn truth, this case comes here today out of his own mouth.\u201d\nOf course, this is not to suggest that every white judge is racist, or that every male judge blames the survivors of sexual assault for the crimes enacted on them. A variety of different reasons have been suggested for disparities in sentencing , including but not limited to discriminatory sentencing practices. And, indeed, the problem of victim-blaming is not confined to male judges \u2013 in January, Joanna Greenberg gave a non-custodial sentence to a teacher convicted on two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust, telling him: \u201cThere is no evidence you groomed her. If anything, it was she who groomed you. You gave way to temptation at a time when you were emotionally vulnerable because of problems with your wife\u2019s pregnancy. She was intelligent and used that intelligence to manipulate people emotionally.\u201d Yet, it still bears asking: is a white, male-dominated judiciary fully able to serve justice to a far more diverse community than that represented within its own ranks?\nI hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian\u2019s journalism.\nFrom Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what\u2019s happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest \u2013 not profit motives.\nAnd we avoid the trap that befalls much US media \u2013 the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we\u2019re not afraid to name who is responsible. And as a global news organization, we\u2019re able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective on US politics \u2013 one so often missing from the insular American media bubble.\nAround the world, readers can access the Guardian\u2019s paywall-free journalism because of our unique reader-supported model. That\u2019s because of people like you. Our readers keep us independent, beholden to no outside influence and accessible to everyone \u2013 whether they can afford to pay for news, or not.\nIf you can, please consider supporting the Guardian today. Thank you.\nBetsy Reed\nEditor, Guardian US"], "citation_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/law/womens-blog/2015/aug/05/judiciary-reflect-diverse-society-women-ethnic-minorities-judges-rape"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_d38584e7-2eaf-499a-9d73-320adb675799"}

But that\u2019s not the coldest water could be. \u201cSupercooled\u201d water is water that exists below that point. Scientists in a few labs have now made the coldest water yet.\nOne team of researchers got their liquid water as cold as 230 Kelvin, and another down to 228 Kelvin\u2014that\u2019s around -50 Fahrenheit (-45 Celsius). This is cool for science reasons alone, since this \u201cdeeply supercooled\u201d region is difficult to probe with experiments. But there are other reasons: Water is weird and super important for understanding this planet we live on. And it doesn\u2019t always obey the rules you learned in high school: It can exist as a liquid at temperatures as low as -31 degrees F (-35 degrees C) in our own atmosphere, and it has strange properties that only get weirder at temperatures that cold. Right around these cold temperatures, in fact, it reaches a sort of weird mathematical kink, also known as a \u201csingularity.\u201d\n\u201cYet what sort of singularity might water be approaching still represents an unresolved puzzle that has prompted the formulation of conflicting scenarios to interpret its origin,\u201d the authors write in one of the studies published last week in Physical Review Letters, lead by Ph.D student Claudia Goy from the Institute for Nuclear Physics at Goethe University, Frankfurt. Another team from Sweden, Korea and Japan may have reached that singularity, and published their paper last month in Science.\nHere\u2019s a reminder: physicists use temperature simply as the average kinetic energy of a collection of molecules. Basically, the less the molecules move around and vibrate, the lower their temperature. This isn\u2019t really temperature like stepping into the arctic. It\u2019s describing the behavior of a tiny collection of particles in a system built by physicists.\nWhether those molecules actually begin to \u201cfreeze,\u201d or form a crystal, depends on a host of other factors. It requires an initial crystal, or nucleus, to form and begin attracting other molecules. Water prefers to be a crystal at temperatures below its freezing point, but scientists can build systems which prevent that crystallization. Some of water\u2019s physical properties are unlike those of other liquids, too: think about how water expands when it freezes, something that normally doesn\u2019t happen in other liquids\nBoth teams created their own super-cold water by shooting jets of tiny droplets into a vacuum. The smaller the droplet, the colder they\u2019d be able to make it while still keeping it a liquid. Small droplets are also less likely to crystallize from foreign particles. Dividing into smaller pieces exposes more of them to the vacuum, leading to a strange kind of vacuum cooling. Essentially, lowering the pressure causes the particles on the surface to quickly evaporate off. This quickly removes the heat from the droplets and causes their temperature to drop precipitously. The droplets, when measured, record frigid temperatures.\nTaking that temperature is difficult, too. Both experiments used laser pulses to measure the droplets as they traveled and evaporated in the vacuum. Observing how the diameter of the water droplets change as they leave the nozzle gives the researchers a number they can turn into a temperature using a mathematical formula.\nThis might seem like a roundabout way to measure temperature, but \u201cyou cannot put a thermometer next to the droplets and say \u2018okay, this is the temperature,\u2019\u201d Renato Torre from the European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy who was not involved in the research, told Gizmodo. Still, he felt that the methods used by the researchers support the claims in the paper. He also wondered if this would open a debate as to the most reliable temperature-taking methods in these experiments.\nAs for the singularity, the group who got their water down to 228 Kelvin definitely noticed some weirdness: The water appeared to exist with two different density phases simultaneously, based on how clusters of a few connected water molecules stacked up in the droplets. Computer modeling demonstrated that this surprising result could explain water\u2019s weird density behaviors, explained Tim Wogan for PhysicsWorld.\nPaola Gallo from Roma Tre University in Italy called that experiment important in a commentary for Science. But another researcher, Alan Soper from the UK\u2019s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, told Wogan that he didn\u2019t think one could draw detailed conclusions, and that perhaps the changes observed by that team were the beginning of the water crystallizing. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly seen something and it\u2019s very interesting,\u201d he said, \u201cBut what\u2019s actually causing it is probably something we don\u2019t have a straightforward answer to.\u201d\nRegardless, water is important. It\u2019s present in the clouds, in our tissues, and required to understand all sorts of phenomena present on our planet.

[1]\nThe song's composer, Charles Dumont , states in the book \u00c9dith Piaf, Opinions publiques , by Bernard Marchois (TF1 Editions 1995), that Michel Vaucaire's original title was \"Non, je ne trouverai rien\" (No, I will not find anything) and that the song was meant for the French singer Rosalie Dubois . However, thinking of Piaf, he changed the title to \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (No, I Regret Nothing).\nAccording to journalist Jean Noli, in his book \u00c9dith (\u00c9ditions Stock 1973), when Dumont and Vaucaire visited Piaf's home at Boulevard Lannes in Paris, on 24 October 1960, she received them in a very impolite and unfriendly manner. Dumont had tried to offer Piaf his compositions on several occasions, but she disliked them and had refused them. On that day she was furious that her housekeeper Danielle had arranged a meeting with the two men without informing her, so she let them wait an hour in her living room before she appeared. She told them she would listen to one song only. Dumont sang Non, je ne regrette rien , to which Piaf reacted extremely positively, saying \"This is the song I have been waiting for. It will be my biggest success! I want it for my coming performance at L'Olympia!\"\nPiaf dedicated her recording of the song to the Foreign Legion . [2] At the time of the recording, France was engaged in a military conflict, the Algerian War (1954\u20131962), and the 1st REP ( 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment )\u2014which backed the failed 1961 putsch against president Charles de Gaulle and the civilian leadership of Algeria\u2014adopted the song when their resistance was broken. The leadership of the Regiment was arrested and tried but the non-commissioned officers, corporals and Legionnaires were assigned to other Foreign Legion formations. They left the barracks singing the song, which has now become part of the Foreign Legion heritage and is sung when they are on parade.\nThe song begins, Non, rien de rien / Non, je ne regrette rien (\"No, nothing at all / No, I regret nothing\"). It goes on to describe how the singer has swept away all of his/her past and cares nothing for it, ending Car ma vie, car mes joies / Aujourd'hui, \u00e7a commence avec toi (\"For my life, for my joys / Today, it starts with you\").\nThe song has been recorded by other performers, including:\n- Piaf herself recorded an English version, titled No Regrets .\n- Shirley Bassey in 1965, (reaching No. 39 on the UK charts) and on the album Love Songs .\n- Karen Akers on her 1981 album \"Presenting Karen Akers\".\n- German singer Martinique released a Disco/Synth-Pop version \"No Regrets (Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien)\" in 1984\n- Bad Boys Blue in 1989, on album \" The Fifth \" recorded an English version titled No Regrets .\n- The rock band Half Man Half Biscuit recorded a 1991 English version titled No Regrets .\n- Emmylou Harris contributed an English version to the 1994 multi-artist \"Tribute to Edith Piaf\" album.\n- Elaine Paige on 1994 album Piaf , released to coincide with her portrayal of the lead character in the play of the same name.\n- Brazilian singer C\u00e1ssia Eller in 2001 Ac\u00fastico MTV album.\n- Vicky Leandros on her 2010 album \"Zeitlos\" (Timeless) sung in German with the title \"Nein, ich bereue nichts\" .\n- Cajun band Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys on their 2011 album Grand Isle .\n- Frances McDormand as Captain DuBois sings the song in Madagascar 3: Europe\u2019s Most Wanted .\n- Raquel Bitton sang \"No Regrets\" in the film \"Piaf..Her story..Her songs\" and CD \"Raquel Bitton sings Edith Piaf\"\n- \"Nej, jag \u00e5ngrar ingenting\" (Swedish) by Anita Lindblom in 1961\n- \"Ne oplakujem\" (Croatian) by Tereza Kesovija in 1962\n- \"Ne oplakujem\" (Croatian) by Ana \u0160tefok in 1964\n- \"Ne, ne \u017ealim ni za \u010dim\" (Serbian) by Lola Novakovi\u0107 in 1964\n- \"Nej, jag \u00e5ngrar ingenting\" (Swedish) by Gun Sj\u00f6berg in 1966\n- \"Nelituj\" (Czech) by Sv\u011btlana N\u00e1lepkov\u00e1 in 2005\n- \"Ne, ni mi \u017eal\" (Slovenian) by Ale\u0161 Polajnar in 2014\n- \"No dico no\" (Italian) by Dalida\n- \"No me puedo quejar\" (Spanish) by Dalida\n- \"Nah de Nah\" (Spanish) by Javiera Mena\n- \"Nem, nem b\u00e1nok semmit sem\" (Hungarian) by V\u00e1ri \u00c9va\n- Elvina Makarian (Armenian Legendary Jazz Singer).\n- In the United Kingdom, the song was at one time associated with the former Conservative politician Norman Lamont , former Chancellor of the Exchequer , who quoted the song's title to sum up his political career.

Some researchers have found that gay men's endorsement of beliefs that people can detect sexual orientation from voice (voice discreteness) and that speakers cannot change the way they sound (voice immutability) were associated with a stronger self-perception of sounding gay. However, not all gay men speak with a higher voice. Would you like more information on this topic?", "references": ["From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nParticularly within North American English , gay male speech has been the focus of numerous modern stereotypes, as well as sociolinguistic studies. Scientific research has uncovered phonetically significant features produced by many gay men and demonstrated that listeners accurately guess speakers' sexual orientation at rates greater than chance. [1] Historically, gay male speech characteristics have been highly stigmatized and their usage may be sometimes coded to a limited number of settings outside of the workplace or other public spaces.\nResearch does not support the notion that gay speech entirely adopts feminine speech characteristics \u2013 rather, that it selectively adopts some of those features. [2] Gay speech characteristics appear to be learned (rather than innate) ways of speaking, like many aspects of language, though their origins and process of adoption by men remain unclear. [3] One particularly relevant feature is sometimes known as the gay lisp , though researchers confirm that it is not technically a lisp .\nThere are similarities between gay male speech and the speech of other members within the LGBTQ+ community. Features of lesbian speech have also been confirmed in the 21st century, though they are far less socially noticed than features of gay male speech. Drag queen speech is a further topic of research and, while some drag queens may also identify as gay men, a description of their speech styles may not be so binary (gay versus straight). [4] Like with other marginalized communities, speech codes can be deeply tied to local, intimate communities and/or subcultures.\nLinguists have attempted to isolate exactly what makes gay men's English distinct from that of other demographics since the early 20th century, typically by contrasting it with straight male speech or comparing it to female speech. [5] In older work, speech pathologists often focused on high pitch among men, in its resemblance to women, as a defect. [6] Since the gay community consists of many smaller subcultures , gay male speech does not uniformly fall under a single homogeneous category. [7]\nWhat is sometimes colloquially described as a gay \"lisp\" [8] is one manner of speech associated with gay speakers of North American English, and perhaps other dialects or languages. [9] It involves a marked pronunciation of sibilant consonants (particularly / s / and / z / ). [10] [11] Speech scientist Benjamin Munson and his colleagues have argued that this is not a mis-articulated /s/ (and therefore, not technically a lisp ) as much as a hyper-articulated /s/ . [12] Specifically, gay men are documented as pronouncing /s/ with higher-frequency spectral peaks , an extremely negatively skewed spectrum, and a longer duration than heterosexual men. [13] [14] [15] However, not all gay American men speak with this hyper-articulated /s/ [16] (perhaps fewer than half), [17] and some men who identify as heterosexual also produce this feature. [16]\nA 2006 study of gay men in the Upper Midwestern American dialect region found that they tend to lower the TRAP vowel (except before a nasal consonant ) as well as the DRESS vowel. [18] This linguistic phenomenon is normally associated with the California vowel shift and also reported in a study of a gay speaker of California English itself, who strengthened these same features and also fronted the GOOSE and GOAT vowels when speaking with friends more than in other speaking situations. The study suggests that a California regional sound can be employed or intensified by gay American men for stylistic effect, including to evoke a \"fun\" or \"partier\" persona. [19]\nSome other speech features are also stereotyped as markers of gay or bisexual males: carefully enunciated pronunciation, wide pitch range (high and rapidly changing pitch), breathy voice , lengthened fricative sounds, [10] pronunciation of /t/ as /ts/ and /d/ as /dz/ ( affrication ), [20] [5] etc. Research shows that gay speech characteristics include many of the same characteristics other speakers use when attempting to speak with special carefulness or clarity, including over-articulating and expanding the vowel spaces in the mouth. [21]\nIn terms of perception, the \"gay sound\" in North American English is popularly presumed to involve the pronunciation of sibilants ( /s/ , /z/ , /\u0283/ ) with noticeable assibilation , sibilation, hissing, or stridency. [10] Frontal , dentalized and negatively skewed articulations of /s/ (the aforementioned \"gay lisp\") are indeed found to be the most powerful perceptual indicators to a listener of a male speaker's sexual orientation, [22] with experiments revealing that such articulations are perceived as \"gayer-sounding\" and \"younger-sounding\". [23] So even if a speaker does not display all of these patterns, the stereotype of gay speech and the coordination of other non-linguistic factors, e.g. dress, mannerisms, can help form the perception of these accents in speech.\nGay speech is also widely stereotyped as resembling women's speech. [24] However, on the basis of phonetics , Benjamin Munson and his colleagues' research has discovered that gay male speech does not simply or categorically imitate female speech. [25]\nIn one Canadian study, listeners correctly identified gay speakers in 62% of cases. [17] A Stanford University experiment analyzed the acoustics of eight males (four straight and four gay), who were recorded reading passages, through the perception of listener-subjects and tasked these listeners with categorizing speakers by adjectives corresponding to common U.S. stereotypes of gay men. [24] The listeners were generally able to correctly identify the sexual orientation of the speakers, reflecting the stereotypes. However, there were no statistically significant differences the listeners identified, if they existed at all, based on intonation. [24] These findings are representative of other studies as well. [26]\nAnother study [7] examined the duration of certain sounds ( /\u00e6/ , /e\u026a/ , and the onset of /s/ and /l/ ), frequency of stressed vowels , voice-onset time of voiceless aspirated consonants , and the release of word-final stop consonants . The study found some correlation between these speech traits and sexual orientation, but also clarified the study's narrow scope on only certain phonetic features. [7]\nLanguage and gender scholar Robin Lakoff not only compares gay male with female speech but also claims that gay men deliberately imitate the latter, [27] claiming this to include an increased use of superlatives , inflected intonation , and lisping . [28] Later linguists have re-evaluated Lakoff's claims and concluded that these characterizations are not consistent for women, instead reflecting stereotypes that may have social meaning and importance but that do not fully capture actual gendered language use. [29]\nLinguist David Crystal correlated the use among men of an \"effeminate\" or \"simpering\" voice with a widened range of pitch , glissando effects between stressed syllables, greater use of fall-rise and rise-fall tones, vocal breathiness and huskiness, and occasionally more switching to the falsetto register. [30] Still, research has not confirmed any unique intonation or pitch qualities of gay speech. [24] Some such characteristics have been portrayed as mimicking women's speech and judged as derogatory toward or trivializing of women. [31]\nA study of over 300 Flemish Dutch -speaking Belgian participants, men and women, found a \"significantly higher prevalence\" of a \"lisp\"-like feature in gay men than in other demographics. [9] Several studies have also examined and confirmed gay speech characteristics in Puerto Rican Spanish and other dialects of Caribbean Spanish .

While AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning , in particular, are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.\nArtificial intelligence allows machines to model, or even improve upon, the capabilities of the human mind. And from the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI is increasingly becoming part of everyday life \u2014 and an area companies across every industry are investing in.\nArtificial Intelligence Definition: Basics of AI\nExamples of Artificial Intelligence\nAI Benefits, Challenges and Future\nHistory of AI, a Timeline\nArtificial Intelligence Definition: Basics of AI\nBroadly speaking, artificially intelligent systems can perform tasks commonly associated with human cognitive functions \u2014 such as interpreting speech, playing games and identifying patterns. They typically learn how to do so by processing massive amounts of data, looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. In many cases, humans will supervise an AI\u2019s learning process, reinforcing good decisions and discouraging bad ones. But some AI systems are designed to learn without supervision \u2014 for instance, by playing a video game over and over until they eventually figure out the rules and how to win.\nIntelligence is tricky to define, which is why AI experts typically distinguish between strong AI and weak AI .\nStrong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence , is a machine that can solve problems it\u2019s never been trained to work on \u2014 much like a human can. This is the kind of AI we see in movies, like the robots from Westworld or the character Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation . This type of AI doesn\u2019t actually exist yet.\nThe creation of a machine with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any task is the Holy Grail for many AI researchers, but the quest for artificial general intelligence has been fraught with difficulty. And some believe strong AI research should be limited, due to the potential risks of creating a powerful AI without appropriate guardrails.\nIn contrast to weak AI, strong AI represents a machine with a full set of cognitive abilities \u2014 and an equally wide array of use cases \u2014 but time hasn't eased the difficulty of achieving such a feat.\nWeak AI, sometimes referred to as narrow AI or specialized AI, operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence applied to a narrowly defined problem (like driving a car, transcribing human speech or curating content on a website).\nWeak AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well. While these machines may seem intelligent, they operate under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.\nWeak AI examples include:\n- Siri, Alexa and other smart assistants\n- Self-driving cars\n- Google search\n- Conversational bots\n- Email spam filters\n- Netflix\u2019s recommendations\nAlthough the terms \u201cmachine learning\u201d and \u201cdeep learning\u201d come up frequently in conversations about AI, they should not be used interchangeably. Deep learning is a form of machine learning, and machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nA machine learning algorithm is fed data by a computer and uses statistical techniques to help it \u201clearn\u201d how to get progressively better at a task, without necessarily having been specifically programmed for that task. Instead, ML algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. To that end, ML consists of both supervised learning (where the expected output for the input is known thanks to labeled data sets) and unsupervised learning (where the expected outputs are unknown due to the use of unlabeled data sets).\nDeep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through a biologically inspired neural network architecture. The neural networks contain a number of hidden layers through which the data is processed, allowing the machine to go \u201cdeep\u201d in its learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.\nExamples of Artificial Intelligence\nAI can be divided into four categories , based on the type and complexity of the tasks a system is able to perform. They are:\n- Reactive machines\n- Limited memory\n- Theory of mind\n- Self awareness\nA reactive machine follows the most basic of AI principles and, as its name implies, is capable of only using its intelligence to perceive and react to the world in front of it. A reactive machine cannot store a memory and, as a result, cannot rely on past experiences to inform decision making in real time.\nPerceiving the world directly means that reactive machines are designed to complete only a limited number of specialized duties. Intentionally narrowing a reactive machine\u2019s worldview has its benefits, however: This type of AI will be more trustworthy and reliable, and it will react the same way to the same stimuli every time.\n- Deep Blue was designed by IBM in the 1990s as a chess-playing supercomputer and defeated international grandmaster Gary Kasparov in a game. Deep Blue was only capable of identifying the pieces on a chess board and knowing how each moves based on the rules of chess, acknowledging each piece\u2019s present position and determining what the most logical move would be at that moment. The computer was not pursuing future potential moves by its opponent or trying to put its own pieces in better position. Every turn was viewed as its own reality, separate from any other movement that was made beforehand.\n- Google\u2019s AlphaGo is also incapable of evaluating future moves but relies on its own neural network to evaluate developments of the present game, giving it an edge over Deep Blue in a more complex game. AlphaGo also bested world-class competitors of the game, defeating champion Go player Lee Sedol in 2016.\nLimited memory AI has the ability to store previous data and predictions when gathering information and weighing potential decisions \u2014 essentially looking into the past for clues on what may come next. Limited memory AI is more complex and presents greater possibilities than reactive machines.\nLimited memory AI is created when a team continuously trains a model in how to analyze and utilize new data or an AI environment is built so models can be automatically trained and renewed.\nWhen utilizing limited memory AI in ML, six steps must be followed:\n- Establish training data\n- Create the machine learning model\n- Ensure the model can make predictions\n- Ensure the model can receive human or environmental feedback\n- Store human and environmental feedback as data\n- Reiterate the steps above as a cycle\nTheory of mind is just that \u2014 theoretical. We have not yet achieved the technological and scientific capabilities necessary to reach this next level of AI.\nThe concept is based on the psychological premise of understanding that other living things have thoughts and emotions that affect the behavior of one\u2019s self. In terms of AI machines, this would mean that AI could comprehend how humans, animals and other machines feel and make decisions through self-reflection and determination, and then utilize that information to make decisions of their own. Essentially, machines would have to be able to grasp and process the concept of \u201cmind,\u201d the fluctuations of emotions in decision-making and a litany of other psychological concepts in real time, creating a two-way relationship between people and AI.\nOnce theory of mind can be established, sometime well into the future of AI , the final step will be for AI to become self-aware. This kind of AI possesses human-level consciousness and understands its own existence in the world, as well as the presence and emotional state of others. It would be able to understand what others may need based on not just what they communicate to them but how they communicate it.\nSelf-awareness in AI relies both on human researchers understanding the premise of consciousness and then learning how to replicate that so it can be built into machines.\nArtificial intelligence technology takes many forms, from chatbots to navigation apps and wearable fitness trackers. The below examples illustrate the breadth of potential AI applications.\nChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot capable of producing written content in a range of formats, from essays to code and answers to simple questions. Launched in November 2022 by OpenAI, ChatGPT is powered by a large language model that allows it to closely emulate human writing.\nGoogle Maps uses location data from smartphones, as well as user-reported data on things like construction and car accidents, to monitor the ebb and flow of traffic and assess what the fastest route will be.\nPersonal assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana use natural language processing , or NLP, to receive instructions from users to set reminders, search for online information and control the lights in people\u2019s homes. In many cases, these assistants are designed to learn a user\u2019s preferences and improve their experience over time with better suggestions and more tailored responses.\nSnapchat filters use ML algorithms to distinguish between an image\u2019s subject and the background, track facial movements and adjust the image on the screen based on what the user is doing.\nSelf-driving cars are a recognizable example of deep learning, since they use deep neural networks to detect objects around them, determine their distance from other cars, identify traffic signals and much more.\nThe wearable sensors and devices used in the healthcare industry also apply deep learning to assess the health condition of the patient, including their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and heart rate. They can also derive patterns from a patient\u2019s prior medical data and use that to anticipate any future health conditions.\nMuZero, a computer program created by DeepMind, is a promising frontrunner in the quest to achieve true artificial general intelligence. It has managed to master games it has not even been taught to play, including chess and an entire suite of Atari games, through brute force, playing games millions of times.\nAI Benefits, Challenges and Future\nAI has many uses \u2014 from boosting vaccine development to automating detection of potential fraud . AI companies raised $66.8 billion in funding in 2022, according to CB Insights research , more than doubling the amount raised in 2020. Because of its fast-paced adoption, AI is making waves in a variety of industries.\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\u2019s 2022 report on AI in banking found more than half of financial services companies already use AI solutions for risk management and revenue generation. The application of AI in banking could lead to upwards of $400 billion in savings.\nAs for medicine, a 2021 World Health Organization report noted that while integrating AI into the healthcare field comes with challenges, the technology \u201cholds great promise,\u201d as it could lead to benefits like more informed health policy and improvements in the accuracy of diagnosing patients.\nAI has also made its mark on entertainment. The global market for AI in media and entertainment is estimated to reach $99.48 billion by 2030, growing from a value of $10.87 billion in 2021, according to Grand View Research . That expansion includes AI uses like recognizing plagiarism and developing high-definition graphics.\nWhile AI is certainly viewed as an important and quickly evolving asset, this emerging field comes with its share of downsides .\nThe Pew Research Center surveyed 10,260 Americans in 2021 on their attitudes toward AI. The results found 45 percent of respondents are equally excited and concerned, and 37 percent are more concerned than excited. Additionally, more than 40 percent of respondents said they considered driverless cars to be bad for society. Yet the idea of using AI to identify the spread of false information on social media was more well received, with close to 40 percent of those surveyed labeling it a good idea.\nAI is a boon for improving productivity and efficiency while at the same time reducing the potential for human error. But there are also some disadvantages, like development costs and the possibility for automated machines to replace human jobs . It\u2019s worth noting, however, that the artificial intelligence industry stands to create jobs, too \u2014 some of which have not even been invented yet.\nWhen one considers the computational costs and the technical data infrastructure running behind artificial intelligence, actually executing on AI is a complex and costly business. Fortunately, there have been massive advancements in computing technology, as indicated by Moore\u2019s Law , which states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years while the cost of computers is halved.\nAlthough many experts believe that Moore\u2019s Law will likely come to an end sometime in the 2020s, this has had a major impact on modern AI techniques \u2014 without it, deep learning would be out of the question, financially speaking. Recent research found that AI innovation has actually outperformed Moore\u2019s Law, doubling every six months or so as opposed to two years.\nBy that logic, the advancements artificial intelligence has made across a variety of industries have been major over the last several years. And the potential for an even greater impact over the next several decades seems all but inevitable .\nHistory of AI, a Timeline\nIntelligent robots and artificial beings first appeared in ancient Greek myths. And Aristotle\u2019s development of syllogism and its use of deductive reasoning was a key moment in humanity\u2019s quest to understand its own intelligence.

Ultimately, the decision to convert salary to bonuses depends on each athlete's individual financial situation and goals.", "references": ["Young athletes who are drafted onto a pro team are suddenly wealthy at a very young age. It's a rare 20-something who's prepared for that. They often lack the financial knowledge to manage the large sums of money they're earning, Sports Illustrated noted.\n1\nAnd they're mostly focused on getting on the field and scoring points. Contrast that with someone who builds a career or their own business over decades. They have time to learn about managing that money and often a network of long-standing, trusted, and knowledgeable connections to help them.\nTyson and Iverson are among many athletes who didn't plan ahead and budget for the funds they would need later in life but instead lived a lifestyle based on their peak earnings. Iverson is now waiting to cash in on a $32 million rainy-day trust fund sponsored by Reebok as part of a previous deal he made with the brand. But he can't access the trust fund until 2030.\nComprehensive money-management training programs for players could offer them information that goes beyond simple recommendations for investments or rookie camp workshops, according to Lusardi and Camerer.\n5\nTheir suggestions for players\u2014figuring out how far into the future their money can last and how to build a budget that allows them to achieve their objectives\u2014are good advice for anyone, though.\nRegardless of your net worth , you have to play an active role in the management of your financial affairs. Even the best money manager won't care about your money as much as you do and, for that reason, you have to be the final and most important decision maker. And those decisions have to be grounded in financial knowledge.\nIf you know very little about managing money, it's never too late to change that. Financial literacy and money management education can help you understand everything from the rewards of compound interest to how financial markets work and develop healthy financial habits.\nIn June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) can't limit education-related benefits\u2014such as paid internships and postgraduate scholarships\u2014for athlete recruits.\n8\nThere has been a long-standing controversy over the sizable revenue generated by college sports. The players, who actually create the income, see none at all. The NCAA maintains that not compensating athletes preserves amateurism in college sports.\n9\nMany of the athletes who find themselves broke are big spenders. They make the mistake of matching their spending level to what their peak earnings allow (or beyond). When those earnings end, the payments due on houses, cars, and a lavish lifestyle continue\u2014and the athletes fall off a financial cliff.\nGood, long-term money management is contrary to the accumulation of \"stuff.\" Billionaire Warren Buffett may be as famous for his modest lifestyle as he is for his wealth. NFL player Glover Quin drove the same SUV for years.\n6\n\"I never had a Bentley. I never had a Maserati,\" he told NBCSports. \"My wife and I lived well. We just didn\u2019t live extravagantly.\"\n10\nAthletes' spending isn't all on material luxuries, of course. It's also easy for players to become cash machines for family and friends who need support or are hopeful entrepreneurs.\n11\n\"There's a pressure that comes with being the African-American success story,\" wealth manager Humble Lukanga told The Washington Post . (Lukanga manages some $500 million for mostly Black clients in sports and entertainment.) \"You are some community's pride and joy. And that community has protected you. That community has given you free haircuts when you couldn't afford it. That community has sponsored your football teams, your basketball team.\"\n12\nEven a multimillion-dollar salary only goes so far, though. Armed with sound financial knowledge, young athletes can budget for being generous with their community without putting themselves at financial risk.\nRegardless of your income level, it's smart to live a lifestyle that doesn't stretch your budget. Not only will it set you up for financial freedom, but it's far easier to sleep at night when you're not worried about the next paycheck.\nYes, there are great examples of iconic athletes who've achieved enduring financial success . The richest athlete of all time is basketball superstar Michael Jordan, whose $2.1 billion fortune was built from his NBA income, sponsorships, and investments, including a majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets.\n13\nNBA player Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson formed Magic Johnson Enterprises years before he stopped playing and has built it into a $1 billion conglomerate.\n14\nSerena Williams won more tennis Grand Slams (23) than any other player and four Olympic gold medals. Her career prize money made her the second highest-paid woman athlete, and she's put that\u2014and income from almost 20 corporate sponsorships\u2014to good use in diverse business interests and her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures.\n15\n16\nFinancial literacy education before any contracts are signed, ongoing money management training beyond rookie camp workshops, and compensation structures that pay out over time would be helpful. The key for young pros is to manage a short spike of high income so that it can last a lifetime.\nCompared to most people, pro athletes have very short careers. And if their contract isn\u2019t renewed or they get injured, their careers can unexpectedly be cut even shorter. In addition, pro athletes tend to be intensely focused on their sport, sometimes to the exclusion of other important matters, such as their personal finances.\nTake a cue from the many athletes who have found themselves broke later in life. Spending so much today that you can't save anything or invest for a secure future is a losing proposition regardless of how much money you make. If you don't consider yourself a good money manager, ask for help.\nSponsored\nAccess to World-Class Learning From Top Universities\nAre you interested in developing skills related to banking, investment management, or other fields related to finance?

Treatment for ureterolithiasis depends on the underlying cause and may include preventive antibiotic therapy, surgery, or a wait-and-see approach.", "references": ["Hydronephrosis is swelling of one or both kidneys. Kidney swelling happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result. This can occur from a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys (ureters) or from an anatomical defect that doesn't allow urine to drain properly.\nHydronephrosis can happen at any age. Hydronephrosis in children may be diagnosed during infancy or sometimes during a prenatal ultrasound before the baby is born.\nHydronephrosis doesn't always cause symptoms. When they occur, signs and symptoms of hydronephrosis might include:\n- Pain in the side and back that may travel to the lower abdomen or groin\n- Urinary problems, such as pain with urination or feeling an urgent or frequent need to urinate\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Fever\n- Failure to thrive, in infants\nTypically, urine passes from the kidney through a tube called a ureter that drains into the bladder, and then out of the body. But, sometimes urine backs up or remains inside the kidney or in the ureter. That's when hydronephrosis can develop.\nSome common causes of hydronephrosis include:\n- Partial blockage in the urinary tract. Urinary tract blockages often form where the kidney meets the ureter. Less commonly, blockages may occur where the ureter meets the bladder.\n- Vesicoureteral reflux. Vesicoureteral reflux happens when urine flows backward through the ureter from the bladder up into the kidney. Typically, urine flows only one way in the ureter. Urine flowing the wrong way makes it difficult for the kidney to empty properly and causes the kidney to swell.\nLess-common causes of hydronephrosis include kidney stones, a tumor in the abdomen or pelvis, and problems with nerves that lead to the bladder.\nYour health care provider may refer you to a doctor who specializes in conditions affecting the urinary system (urologist) for your diagnosis.\nTests for diagnosing hydronephrosis may include:\n- A blood test to evaluate kidney function\n- A urine test to check for signs of infection or urinary stones that could cause a blockage\n- An ultrasound imaging exam, during which your doctor can view the kidneys, bladder and other urinary structures to identify potential problems\n- A specialized X-ray of the urinary tract that uses a special dye to outline the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra, capturing images before and during urination\nIf necessary, your doctor may recommend additional imaging exams, such as a CT scan or MRI. Another possibility is a test called a MAG3 scan that evaluates function and drainage in the kidney.\nTreatment for hydronephrosis depends on the underlying cause. Although surgery is sometimes needed, hydronephrosis often resolves on its own.\n- Mild to moderate hydronephrosis. Your doctor may opt for a wait-and-see approach to see if you get better on your own. Even so, your doctor may recommend preventive antibiotic therapy to lower the risk of urinary tract infections.\n- Severe hydronephrosis. When hydronephrosis makes it hard for the kidney to function \u2014 as can happen in more-severe hydronephrosis or in hydronephrosis that involves reflux \u2014 surgery may be recommended to fix a blockage or correct reflux.\nLeft untreated, severe hydronephrosis can lead to permanent kidney damage. Rarely, it can cause kidney failure. But hydronephrosis typically affects only one kidney and the other kidney can do the work for both."], "citation_links": ["https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydronephrosis/cdc-20397563"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_15b0a062-73e9-4b34-ab1f-49b47f6458fc"}

If you stay longer that you have been granted, you may be taken to the Immigration facilities, while they investigate, with the risk of being deported.\nThere are no COVID-19 specific entry requirements regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status.\nTesting or screening for COVID-19 is no longer regularly conducted, but may occur upon arrival at airports in Mexico. If you present symptoms of COVID-19 you will be directed to a medical facility. Airlines may deny you to board onward flights.\nYou should check with your travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements.\nIf you are visiting Mexico, your passport should be valid for the proposed duration of your stay in Mexico.\nIf you\u2019re visiting Mexico as a tourist you don\u2019t need a visa. You\u2019ll receive a stamp in your passport with the number of days that you are allowed to stay. If you require a digital version, you can obtain it from the Portal de Servicios INM website, or in advance from the National Institute of Immigration website . The advance option is only possible if your passport is valid for at least 6 months from your intended date of entry to Mexico.\nTo leave the country, you will have to present your passport with the stamp showing the number of days granted. If you lose your passport, you will need to pay a fee to replace the entry stamp. The cost of a replacement is approximately $600 Mexican Pesos, which is payable at a bank, migration officers do not accept cash. The process can be completed at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico, you will be guided on how to make the payment by the immigration officials.\nThere have been reports of bogus immigration officers operating within international airports. You should always refuse offers of help and head directly to the immigration office.\nIf you\u2019re crossing the border into Mexico from the US, and there isn\u2019t an immigration officer at the port of entry to issue you with your visa on arrival or give you an entry stamp, you should find the nearest immigration office to get your passport stamped appropriately before continuing your journey into Mexico. The immigration office can usually be found close to the border area, and customs officials at the border should be able to tell you where to find it. If you fail to clear immigration correctly at this point, it is often more complicated to do so once you have left the border area.\nTourists are not allowed to undertake voluntary (including human rights) work, or activity, or any form of paid employment. If you wish to carry out this type of work, you must get the correct visa from the Mexican Embassy before you travel.\nYou may need a visa to undertake certain adventure or eco-tourism activities like caving, potholing or entomology, especially if they involve any scientific or technological research. The Mexican authorities may define scientific or technological research activities far more broadly than other countries. If you are in any doubt, check with the Mexican Embassy in London well in advance of your visit and ask for written confirmation if necessary.\nIt is no longer possible to switch immigration status in-country. You can\u2019t enter Mexico on a tourist visa and then change it for a work visa. You must apply at the Mexican Consulate of your normal place of residence in plenty of time before you are due to travel.\nImmigration officials at the port of entry may ask to see proof of your departure plans from Mexico before allowing you entry to the country. They can also ask to see proof of your booked accommodation, as well as funds to cover your intended stay while in Mexico.\nIf you have been invited to stay in someone\u2019s home, immigration officials may also ask for a \u201cletter of invitation\u201d from the person you are visiting. This should include as much information as possible, including the host and traveller\u2019s full names and contact details, address while in Mexico and reason for visit.\nCheck whether you will need to declare anything on arrival to customs officials by reading the guidance from the Mexican government (in Spanish). If you have goods to declare, you must fill in an online form prior to travelling to Mexico. If you do not declare goods, these may be seized and you may be fined.\nCheck the Mexican Government guidance on which Agri-food products you can bring into Mexico.\nThe Mexican authorities have suspended the rules which came into effect in May 2011 requiring children under 18 years of age travelling alone, or accompanied by an adult who is not the parent or legal guardian, to apply for a special permit to leave the country. These rules now only apply to Mexican nationals or foreigners with dual Mexican nationality. The accompanying adult may, however, be asked to provide evidence of his or her relationship with the child.\nAlthough there is currently no specific requirement for authorisation by an absent parent, single parents who are not, or who appear not to be, the child\u2019s parent (eg if they have a different family name) may be asked to show evidence of their relationship with the child and the reason why they are travelling with the child. This evidence could include a birth or adoption certificate, divorce or marriage certificates, or a Parental Responsibility Order.\nIf you are travelling to or from Mexico via the US, even if you are only transiting, check the latest US entry requirements at travel advice for the USA and/or with the US Embassy in London . If you don\u2019t have the correct authorisation you will not be allowed to travel to or transit through the US.\nCheck with your closest US Embassy/Consulate for more information.\nYou may need to pay a departure tax when leaving Mexico by air or land. The cost can vary and some airports or border crossings only accept payment in cash. Most airlines include the cost within the ticket price. If in doubt, check with your airline or tour operator.\nAs of 1 April 2021, the State of Quintana Roo charges a tax for all tourists visiting the state. Tourists can make the payment before or during their stay. Proof of payment must be presented at the airport prior to departure. The payment can be made on the VISITAX web portal , available in English. Assistance with the web portal is also available at Cancun Airport.\nYou can\u2019t bring meat or dairy products into Mexico from the UK.\nUK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Mexico and are accepted for entry, airside transit and exit from Mexico. You should also check the requirements for any country that you are transiting through. All tourists, including holders of ETDs will need to show the entry stamp to leave the country. If you lose your passport with the original stamp, you will need a new one. You can get it replaced at the immigration office at any international airport in Mexico."], "citation_links": ["https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/mexico/entry-requirements"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_570ae83b-5c29-4ef3-bd4c-862925554384"}

It can be caused by a variety of factors and can be dangerous and even fatal if not treated promptly. Some common signs of colic in horses include anxiety or depression, pawing at the ground, looking at the flank, rolling or wanting to lie down, playing in the water bucket but not drinking, absence of defecation, lack of appetite, excessive sweating, unusually high pulse rate of over 50 beats per minute, absence of normal gut noises and frequent attempts to urinate. If you suspect your horse has colic, it is important to get veterinary attention immediately. Most horses with colic can be treated medically but some may require surgical intervention. Treatment may include pain relief, fluid therapy, intestinal lubricants and laxatives, larvicidal deworming and surgery. Is there anything else you would like to know?", "references": ["Colic is a relatively common condition in horses, with studies showing that 4-10% of horses are diagnosed with colic every year.1 However, it is important to be aware that some types of colic are more serious than others.\nWhat is colic and what are the common causes?\nIn veterinary terms, \u201ccolic\u201d simply means abdominal pain. Because this term is so broad, there can be a multitude of underlying conditions \u2013 some of which are more serious than others.\nHorses have a unique and complicated digestive system which predisposes them to different types of colic that can range from being uncomfortable, to being life-threatening:\n- Gas (tympanic)\n- Spasmodic\n- Impaction\n- Displacement/entrapment\n- Torsion (twisted gut)\n- Strangulation\n- Sand\nGas (tympanic) colic\nOccurs when there is an excessive build-up of gas within the large intestine. Horses may look bloated.\nSpasmodic colic\nOne of the most common types of colic and is the result of intestinal cramps or spasms.\nImpaction colic\nOccurs when partially digested feed \u2013 typically roughage \u2013 builds up in the intestine (usually the large intestine), resulting in a blockage or impaction. The horse will often struggle to pass faeces.\nDisplacement/entrapment colic\nOccurs when an area of the intestine moves from its normal location in the abdominal cavity to somewhere else. When this displacement cannot freely move back to its original location, it becomes an entrapment.\nDisplacements and entrapments are very serious because this change in location stretches the blood supply to the intestine, which can result in damage and tissue death.\nTorsion (twisted gut)\nA twisted gut occurs when a portion of the intestine twists on itself, a condition known as intestinal torsion, or when a portion of the intestines inverts into itself, a problem called intussusception. This type of colic accounts for a small proportion of colic cases overall, but the condition is very serious, and often life-threatening when it does occur.\nStrangulation colic\nA twisted gut, displacement or impaction can result in strangulation colic which is very serious. Strangulation colic occurs when the blood supply to an area of the intestines is cut off (strangulated). Cutting off the blood supply results in rapid death of the intestine wall, a life-threatening situation.\nSand colic\nSand colic occurs in horses living in sandy areas, or horses fed from sandy ground. Fine sand particles build up in the large intestines, resulting in colic.\nWhat signs might I see if my horse has colic?\nDespite the many different types of colic, the signs of colic in horses are often non-specific. The typical signs of colic that most horse owners are familiar with include the following:\n- Pawing the ground\n- Flank watching\n- Kicking or biting the flank\n- Tail swishing\n- Repeatedly lying down and getting up again\n- Lying down for extended periods\n- Throwing themselves onto the ground\n- Rolling\n- Curling the upper lip\n- Displaying a stretched stance with hind legs far behind\n- Sweating\n- Increased breathing rate\n- Inappetence\n- Dullness or agitation\n- Groaning\nAs these signs are non-specific, they often give little indication as to what type of colic the horse has.\nWhat should I do if my horse shows signs of colic?\nIf you think your horse has colic, you should call your vet. They will be able to advise on the next steps, and will usually recommend a visit so they can assess your horse and treat accordingly. In many cases, earlier treatment of colic results in better outcomes.\nWhile waiting for your vet to arrive, you should bring your horse into a stable or small sectioned-off area, if safe to do so. Provide deep bedding if your horse is rolling and remove any feed, but still allow constant access to water. Horses that are rolling or getting up and down can be hand walked if it is safe to do so. Make sure you also monitor your horse closely for signs of deterioration.\nWhat is the treatment for colic?\nYour vet may need to visit and assess your horse. They will check their mucus membrane colour, hydration status, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate and gut sounds. Your vet may also perform a rectal examination, nasogastric intubation, abdominal ultrasound, a belly tap or blood sampling. All of these tests help your vet get a more accurate picture of the type of colic affecting your horse, so they can work with you to implement an appropriate treatment plan. Treatment options which your vet will consider often include:\n- Pain relief\n- Antispasmodics\n- Electrolytes and fluid therapy\n- Laxatives\n- Surgery\nPain Relief\nHorses with colic are in pain. Common equine pain-relieving medications such as phenylbutazone are normally used as part of a colic treatment plan.\nAntispasmodics\nSome horses with colic have over-active spasming intestines, meaning medicines that reduce intestinal movement are often appropriate.\nElectrolytes and fluid therapy\nDehydrated horses will need electrolytes and fluids administered via a stomach tube or intravenous drip. Some impactions will also be treated this way.\nLaxatives\nLaxatives such as liquid paraffin can be given using a stomach tube and are particularly useful for cases of impaction as they can help to lubricate the impaction itself, which can help to move it along.\nSurgery\nSurgery may be needed for cases of twisted gut, strangulation and displacement or entrapment. Although these surgeries are often high-risk, owners need to consider that, without surgery, the prognosis for these individuals is extremely poor.\nHow can I help to reduce the chance of my horse developing colic?\nThe unique structure and functioning of the horse\u2019s digestive system means that all horses are potentially prone to colic. However, there are some risk factors associated with colic that owners should be aware of:\n- Worm control \u2013 heavy worm burdens will increase the risk of colic\n- Dietary change \u2013 rapid diet changes will increase the chance of colic developing\n- Roughage quality \u2013 diets predominately containing coarse roughage (such as straw) are often associated with impaction colic\n- Concentrate feeding \u2013 feeding large quantities of concentrates in one or two feeds increases the risk of colic. Feed little and often to reduce this risk\n- Dental health \u2013 poor dentition can be associated with impaction colic\n- Pasture access \u2013 horses with more time at pasture tend to have lower incidences of colic\n- Exercise \u2013 in fit horses with regular exercise, reduced exercise will increase the chance of colic developing\n- Cribbing and wind-sucking \u2013 horses that crib have an increased incidence of colic\n- Transport \u2013 horses have more chance of developing colic after travelling\n- Post pregnancy \u2013 mares have a greater incidence of colic in the two to six months after having a foal\nYou can\u2019t control all of these risk factors, however, being aware of them can allow you to adjust your horse\u2019s management to help minimise their risk of developing colic. Supporting your horse\u2019s digestive health may also be beneficial. Nutri-Gard Extra , Kentucky Karron Oil and B-Complete can all help maintain digestive health.\nIf you have concerns or more questions about colic in horses, be sure to contact one of our equine specialists for further advice.\nReferences:\n1.Dukti, S., Management of Mild Colic.

It is crucial to understand this part of the game of poker, especially when playing for money. Read on to learn about how to split the pot in a poker game.\nWhen players have the same five-card hand, or during games like high-low where certain hands can take parts of the pot, the pot has to be split.\nSplitting divides the pot into halves, or even smaller parts, so different players can share the winnings evenly. At casinos, dealers do this for you, but you\u2019ll need to manage the pots, the math, and the winnings yourself at home games.\nPots get split in a variety of situations:\n- When two or more players have the same five-card hand. Keep in mind that in Texas Hold\u2019Em, every player may play the board, meaning that the five community cards make everyone\u2019s best hand; in this case, every player would take an equal portion of the pot.\n- In high-low games, when some players win the high and others win the low\n- In games like Chicago, when certain cards (in this case, the highest spade in the hole) entitle players to half the pot\nOn the surface, splitting pots is easy enough: take the pot, split it evenly, and each player takes their winnings.\nThis is especially easy when two players have the same five-card hand: each takes half. If it\u2019s three or four or more players, all with the same hand, divide the pot by the number of players, and each player collects their winnings.\nHowever, things can get tricky fast.\nIn high-low poker variants, the players with the highest and lowest hands each win half of the pot. The easiest split pot in high-low games is when one player wins the high pot, and the other wins the low pot, as the total pot is simply split in half. If a single player has both the high and low hands, they win the entire pot.\nIn games like Omaha High-Low, where it is common for several players to have identical winning low or high hands, the pot needs to be split along more complicated lines. This is because a different number of winners may be declared for the high and low pots. In all cases, the total pot is divided evenly in half, with all high pot winners taking an equal share of their half and all low pot winners taking their equal share. For example, three players have the identical winning high hand, while only one (other) player has the winning low hand. In this case, the players with the high hands each win one-sixth of the pot, and the player with the winning low hand wins half of the pot.\nThe easiest way to manage split pots in high-low games is to first split it in two: one high pot and one low pot. Then, the players who share the winning high hand evenly divide the high pot, and the players with identical winning low hands evenly divide the low pot.\nThe most common instance of high-low split pots is quartering: two players have the same low hand, but one has a better high hand. So they split the low, and one player takes the high, so one player gets 75% of the whole pot and the other gets 25%, a quarter. But it\u2019s not uncommon for three or more players to play for the same high or low, so players might get one-sixth or one-eighth or an even smaller fraction of the pot, while one player ends up taking two-thirds of five-eighths for themselves.\nWhen one player is all in, they can win the main pot: the pot that every active player can theoretically win. But other players can continue betting amongst each other by placing their chips into a side pot: a pot that only some active players can win. Sometimes the side pots can get even bigger than the main one!\nOn the surface, side pots are relatively simple: the main pot usually gets stacked near the player who is all in, and the other two players can bet into the side pot. But, when multiple players are all-in, there might be more than one side pot: for instance, a player is blinded all in, another player goes all-in on the flop, and other players continue betting through the river and turn.\nImagine what can happen if there are three or four or more players all in at the same time, with side pots stacked all around the table, while two big stacks keep betting into one another, complicated enough at a Texas Hold\u2019Em table, and even more so at a High-Low game, where all those pots could get split up even more!\nIn these cases, the key is remembering who can win each pot. At casinos, this is simple enough, since the dealer sorts out each pot. But at home games, it\u2019s crucial to remember who can win each pot: every player can win the main pot, including the player who went all in first; then the next side pot can be won by everyone who could match the next all-in bet; and so on. If it sounds complicated, don\u2019t be afraid to take extra steps to sort it out. Make sure to separate the side pots into their own piles of chips. If you play a lot of Omaha High-Low, you might consider keeping a pad and paper at the table!\nInevitably, there will be a pot that can\u2019t be split evenly: a 5-cent chip that can\u2019t be broken down, or an even number of players will try to split a pot with an odd number of chips in it.\nIn these cases, it\u2019s always useful to be able to make change: break down one of the chips into smaller denominations so that the chips can be divvied out as evenly as possible. At casinos, the dealer will handle this. At home games, players can work it out with one another by making change with one another or with the bank.\nBut what to do with an extra chip that can\u2019t be divided evenly? Different games have different rules . Some leave it in the pot for the next hand, some give it to the player closest to the big blind. Others pick a high card, others let the dealer take it. Always know the rules of the home game you\u2019re playing in."], "citation_links": ["https://www.rookieroad.com/poker/how-do-you-split-the-pot-in-a-poker-game/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_505d6a1d-3bb6-42ec-bfc1-1c82c416d68a"}

Established in 2008 as the Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), the franchise is jointly owned by Mohit Burman , Ness Wadia , Preity Zinta and Karan Paul . The team plays its home matches at the PCA Stadium , Mohali. Since 2010 , they also have been playing some of their home games at either Dharamsala or Indore . Apart from the 2014 season when they topped the league table and finished runners-up, the team has made only one other playoff appearance in 13 seasons.\nThe Punjab Kings played in the now-defunct Champions League Twenty20 once, in 2014 as the Kings XI Punjab and finished as semi-finalists. The team name was changed to Punjab Kings in February 2021. In the mini-auction held on 23 December 2022, Punjab Kings made the highest-ever bid for a player in IPL history, paying Rs 18.50 crores for Sam Curran.\nIn 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament the Indian Premier League , based on the Twenty20 format of the game. Franchises for eight cities were made available in an auction held in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The team representing Punjab was bought by the Dabur group's Mohit Burman (46%), the Wadia group's Ness Wadia (23%), Preity Zinta (23%), and Saptarshi Dey of the Dey & Dey Group (minor stake). The group paid a total of $76 million to acquire the franchise.\nAs the Kings XI Punjab, the franchise's catchment areas were the regions of Kashmir , Jammu , Himachal Pradesh , Punjab and Haryana \u2014evident from the letter sequence \"K J H P H\" in the banner of the team's logo. [1] [2]\nFollowing the controversy surrounding the BCCI and Lalit Modi in 2010, the Indian Premier League announced on 10 October 2010 that it had terminated the franchise contracts of Kings XI Punjab and the Rajasthan Royals . The teams announced that they would take legal action to remain in the Indian Premier League. [3] Initially, the team tried to negotiate a solution with the league, but when one could not be reached, they decided to file a case in Mumbai High Court accusing the IPL of getting rid of the two teams so that when the bidding process would start for the 2012 IPL season, the contract would be given to a more lucrative bidder. [4]\nKings XI Punjab was reinstated with the involvement of the High Court . [5]\nOn 17 February 2021, Kings XI Punjab was renamed to Punjab Kings, ahead of the 2021 Indian Premier League . [6] [7] [8] Ness Wadia explained the reason for changing the franchise name was to \"relook at things\" and rebrand after 13 seasons of IPL. He expressed his disappointment over the franchise for \"not being able to win a title\" and expected them to \"start afresh\" after a name change. He added that the name change had been planned two years ago and COVID-19 had just delayed the announcement. [9]\nThe 2008 tournament got off to a slow start for the Kings XI Punjab, with the team losing their first two games. However, 94 runs by Kumar Sangakkara helped them to win the third game. Despite the absence of Brett Lee and Simon Katich (who were committed to tour the West Indies with Australia), the team found its groove. Powered by their balanced bowling line-up [10] and effective top order, [11] the team won nine of its next 10 matches, clinching a berth in the semi-final, where their run in the tournament came to an end with a comprehensive nine-wicket loss to the Chennai Super Kings .\nShaun Marsh was arguably KXIP's star player in the inaugural IPL. [12] [13] The opener from Western Australia was overlooked in the IPL player auctions and was signed by the franchise on 9 April. [14] He finished the tournament as the Orange Cap holder\u2014the award for the player with the most runs across the competition\u2014with an average of 68.44 and a strike rate of 139.68 in 11 innings. Marsh managed to hit one century and five half-centuries across the course of the tournament. [15]\nFinishing as semi-finalists in 2008, Kings XI Punjab started with ambitions to win the trophy. These were supported by their new sponsors Emirates . With two available slots to fill, the Kings XI Punjab made bids on Jerome Taylor and Yusuf Abdulla at the second IPL auction.\nThe team took a hit as most of their Australian cricketers were unavailable. The team lacked available pace bowlers after Jerome Taylor backed out at the last minute with an injury.\nThe team lost badly to the Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), however, they returned to form by beating the Royal Challengers , the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians . Then the team witnessed a roller-coaster ride in their next eight matches with four wins and four losses. The team's semi-final hopes were crushed after losing to the Chennai Super Kings in their last match.\nKings XI Punjab lost six matches to the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Delhi Daredevils, the Royal Challengers Bangalore , the Deccan Chargers , the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians but managed to win a match against Chennai Super Kings when the scores were level and the match went to a Super Over. Kings XI Punjab were boosted by the return of Brett Lee against Kolkata, but he was not at his best. Shaun Marsh returned in the match against the Mumbai Indians. In spite of his good performance, which included a half century, the team lost the match. They ended the 2010 IPL in the last position.\nAustralia's T20I captain George Bailey was leading the squad for the seventh season. Other buys featured the likes of Virender Sehwag , Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Johnson . Kings XI Punjab began the tournament by winning their first five games which were held outside India in UAE due to the general elections. The stand out player was Glenn Maxwell with his unorthodox and powerful hitting, scoring 95, 89 and 95 in his first three innings with a strike rate of over 200 who got equal contribution from South African David Miller, both of them making the side look invincible. There were many innings from the veteran Indian batsman Virender Sehwag and young star Manan Vohra which made the middle order batting easy and allowed the team to qualify for the playoffs. Due to a 122 run knock from Virender Sehwag against the Chennai Super Kings in the semifinal, KXIP made their way to the final. There they faced the Kolkata Knight Riders where they batted first and set a good target of 199 owing to Wriddhiman Saha 's 115. [16] However, due to Manish Pandey 's 94 off 50 balls and his teammates' consistently high strike rate, including Piyush Chawla 's 13 off five balls, KKR were able to win the final by three wickets in the final over of the match. [17]\nKings XI Punjab qualified for the 2014 Champions League Twenty20 as they finished runners-up in the 2014 IPL. They were placed in Group B along with the Hobart Hurricanes (Australia), the Barbados Tridents (West Indies), the Cape Cobras (South Africa) and the Northern Knights (New Zealand).\nKings XI's first match was in their home stadium, the PCA Stadium , Mohali where they beat Hobart Hurricanes by five wickets, overhauling Hobart's 144\u20136 in 17.4 overs. Thisara Perera was named the Man Of The Match with 2\u201317 and 35. Glenn Maxwell top scored in the game with 43. They also won the second match beating the Barbados Tridents by four wickets. They won their third match of the competition against the Northern Knights and qualified for the semi-finals. They continued to win their final group match against the Cape Cobras but were knocked out of the tournament at the semi-final stage with a disappointing defeat against their IPL rivals the Chennai Super Kings, [18] who went on to win the tournament.\nVirender Sehwag joined as head coach as the team looked to recover from two back-to-back last-place finishes in the league. Glenn Maxwell was appointed as the captain. Eoin Morgan , Darren Sammy and Hashim Amla joined the likes of David Miller in the team. The team missed out on a place in the play-offs by a last game defeat to the Rising Pune Supergiant and ended the season in fifth, winning seven out of their 14 games. Hashim Amla finished the season as top scorer with 420 runs including two centuries, and Sandeep Sharma was the top wicket taker with 17 wickets.\nThe Kings XI Punjab squad for the 2018 IPL season included internationals such as: Ravichandran Ashwin , Yuvraj Singh , KL Rahul , Aaron Finch and Chris Gayle . Ashwin was appointed as captain and Brad Hodge as coach. The Tournament started well with KL Rahul scoring a fine fifty off 14 balls to guide KXIP home against Daredevils. Riding on KL Rahul and Chris Gayle's red hot form at the top and Andrew Tye and Mujeeb Ur Rahman with the ball, the team went on to win 5 out of their first six games, eventually becoming favourites to the title. Their weakness in Indian core was however exposed as they could manage just one win in the next eight and ultimately not being qualified for the playoffs despite a dream start from the beginning.\nFranchises confirmed the names of retained players for the 12th season of Indian Premier League. KXIP retained the following players for the 2019 season: KL Rahul, Chris Gayle, Andrew Tye , Mayank Agarwal , Ankit Rajpoot , Mujeeb Ur Rahman , Karun Nair , David Miller and Ravichandran Ashwin. On the auction day (18 December 2018), KXIP snapped up new 13 players: Varun Chakaravarthy, Sam Curran , Mohammed Shami , Prabhsimran Singh, Nicholas Pooran , Moises Henriques , Hardus Viljoen , Darshan Nalkande , Sarfaraz Khan , Arshdeep Singh, Agnivesh Ayachi, Harpreet Brar, and Murugan Ashwin . [19] Kings XI Punjab ended up in sixth position in the league table. KL Rahul was the highest run scorer for the team with 593 runs in 14 matches.\nOn 20 September, the Kings XI started their season campaign. KL Rahul , the Kings' new captain, elected to field first. This thrilling match ended in a tie. Delhi started with a win in the tournament, defeating Punjab's team in the Super Over. Delhi scored 157-runs for the loss of 8 wickets in 20 overs. The team had lost early wickets, but Marcus Stoinis ' brilliant innings helped the Delhi Capitals to build a 157-run target. In response to 158 runs, Punjab also scored 157-runs in 20 overs on Mayank Agarwal 's knock of 89 runs.\nOn 24 September, Kings XI Punjab won their first match of the season defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 97-runs. KL Rahul lost the toss and was put to bat. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal build the Kings XI innings with a 57-run stand for the first wicket. Rahul scored 132 off 69 balls with 14 fours and 7 sixes and helped the Kings XI finish the innings at 206/3 in 20 overs. Chasing a target of 207, the Royal Challengers had lost three wickets in a first four overs. Kings XI's new ball pair of Sheldon Cottrell and Mohammed Shami continued their good work from the first match and Royal Challengers were eventually bowled out for 109. Rahul became the fastest Indian batsman to complete 2000 runs in IPL. However, they were ousted against Rajasthan Royals who successfully chased down 223 and then continued to lose five matches. The losing streak was broken when Punjab defeated Bangalore for second time and then defeated Mumbai Indians in the Super Over and continued to win three more matches against Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata. However, they lost two matches at the end of the tournament. Their last match was against Chennai Super Kings who won comprehensively by 9 wickets, therefore knocking Punjab out of the tournament. They finished the season at the sixth place. KL Rahul was again the highest scorer for the team with 670 runs, while Mohammed Shami topped the bowling charts for the franchise, with 20 wickets from 14 matches."], "citation_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_48c9153d-1605-40e5-a6c0-46ace0e884ce"}

We are rarely given this much insight into the future of the franchise, although you won't find us complaining \u2013 it's good to know all of the historical locations the new Assassin's Creed games will be taking us in 2023 and beyond.\nThe future of Assassin's Creed was unveiled at a special showcase to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. There we saw a stealth-focused experience, new mobile games, and new two flagship open-world RPGs, and the final update for Assassin's Creed Valhalla . We've got details on all of these upcoming Assassin's Creed games below for you, from the mysterious Codename Hexe to the exciting Codename Red.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Bordeaux\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One\nRelease Date: 2023\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is a homage to the early years of the Assassin's Creed series. It's a return to running across rooftops, stalking targets through social stealth, and carefully executed assassinations \u2013 the foundations of Altair and Ezio's original adventures. Set in Baghdad and starring a younger Basim, Assassin's Creed Mirage is going to be a smaller, more self-contained narrative adventure \u2013 a breath of fresh air from the sprawling open-world RPG antics of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Odyssey, and Origins. There's a simplicity to Assassin's Creed Mirage's mission statement that we can't help but appreciate, which is why it's one of the key new games for 2023 that you won't want to miss.\nRECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Quebec, Ubisoft Montreal\nPlatform(s): TBC\nRelease date: TBC (expected 2024)\nAssassin's Creed Infinity is difficult to explain, but it could have a transformative impact on the way that we interact with Assassin's Creed games in the future. Ubisoft is effectively building an interactive hub that will function like the Animus, allowing you to jump between different historical playgrounds while simultaneously progressing the modern-day narrative framing that has been with the series since the beginning. The first two games to join the Infinity Hub will be Assassin's Creed Codename Red and Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe, and it is then expected to expand and evolve over time. It's a little metaverse-y, but it also makes perfect sense for this franchise.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Quebec\nPlatform(s): TBC\nRelease Date: TBC\nAssassin's Creed Codename Red is expected to be the first game to join the Infinity Hub, and the sequel that will finally deliver on a longstanding fan-request: Codename Red is set in feudal Japan. In development at Assassin's Creed Odyssey's Ubisoft Quebec, Codename Red will let us live out a \"very powerful shinobi fantasy\" and has been described as the future of the open-world RPG Assassin's Creed games. It's a wildly exciting proposition, and we're eager to see what Ubisoft delivers here. Sadly, with Assassin's Creed Mirage scheduled to release next year, there's a good chance we won't see Codename Red until 2024 at the earliest.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\nPlatform(s): TBC\nRelease Date: TBC\nAssassin's Creed Codename Hexe is being positioned as a \"a very different type of Assassins' Creed game.\" Details are few and far between, but we do know that it's being created by Assassin's Creed Valhalla developer Ubisoft Montreal and that former Watch Dogs Legion creative director Clint Hocking will be leading production. The first teaser trailer and game's codename suggest that Assassin's Creed Hexe will be set in 16th Century Europe during the infamous witch trials that engulfed the region. We could be in for a weird, subversive open world RPG here with Codename Hexe, and we're honestly here for a little more experimentation from the Assassin's Creed series.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nPlatform(s): Android, iOS\nRelease Date: TBC\nAssassin's Creed Codename Jade is set to be the first truly open world Assassin's Creed game for mobile . Ubisoft has said that it's trying to build an authentic Assassin's Creed experience, albeit one that is totally optimized for touch controls. Assassin's Creed Jade will be set in China in the year 215 BCE \u2013 and, yes, you will be about to parkour across the Great Wall. Codename Jade will also be the first game in the series to let you create your own assassin from scratch, which is a nice touch. Ubisoft has only shown off an in-engine trailer so far, but it was pretty impressive. If Assassin's Creed can truly scale down to mobile and touch controls, it could change the shape of your commute forever.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nPlatform(s): Android, iOS\nRelease Date: TBC\nUbisoft and Netflix have entered a pretty broad collaboration agreement. There's a Netflix Assassin's Creed series in production (with showrunner Jed Stuart at the helm; the writer of such iconic action movies as Die Hard and The Fugitive), and three mobile games in development for Netflix's video game platform . There are games based on the Valiant Hearts and Mighty Quest universes coming, and of course one based in the world of Assassin's Creed too. The Assassin's Creed Netflix game is in early development, but when it does launch it'll be available exclusively on mobile to Netflix subscribers around the world. No other information was shared, but our curiosity has been piqued all the same.\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nPlatform(s): TBC\nRelease Date: TBC\nUbisoft says that it is \"investigating how we will bring back standalone multiplayer experiences into the Assassin's Creed universe.\" Assassin's Creed multiplayer has been atop wish-lists for years now \u2013 it's been nine years since the mode featured in AC4: Black Flag, and eight since co-op appeared in Assassin's Creed Unity . Little is known about this standalone Assassin's Creed multiplayer game, although we know that it'll launch as part of the Assassin's Creed Infinity Hub, and franchise boss Marc-Alexis Cot\u00e9 has confirmed that the codename is 'Assassin's Creed Invictus' .\nReturn to one of the best Assassin's Creed games while you wait these out.\nGet the best gaming deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable gaming news and more!"], "citation_links": ["https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-assassins-creed-games/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_d5ba98aa-d0c9-4a68-93f1-681ef2940a29"}

This allows for time to reflect on the war and its consequences, and to ensure that the memorial is an accurate representation of the events that occurred.", "references": ["On my first deployment to Iraq, in 2004, our infantry battalion of several hundred Marines lost 21 killed in action. Immediately, we erected our own modest memorials: An ever-expanding roster of the photographs of the fallen hung outside our battalion headquarters in Fallujah; many of us wrote the names of lost friends in black marker on the inside of our body armor, to keep them close; eventually, firebases were dedicated in their honor. The impulse to memorialize was powerful. We did it for them, but also for ourselves. A promise to remember was also a promise that if we, too, were killed, we would not be forgotten.\nIt has been 17 years since the attacks of September 11, and the wars we\u2019ve been fighting since then haven\u2019t yet ended. Already, though, in 2017, Congress passed the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act, which authorized the construction of a monument on the National Mall. In order to pass it, Congress had to exempt the memorial from a requirement that prohibits erecting such monuments until ten years after a war\u2019s conclusion. Supporters argued that waiting wasn\u2019t a reasonable option: Before too long, the war\u2019s earliest combatants might not be around to witness the dedication, and besides, there\u2019s no telling if and when these wars will finally conclude. Which, of course, only highlights the challenges\u2014even the paradox\u2014of memorializing an ongoing war that is now our nation\u2019s longest overseas conflict.\nCommunities around the country have already erected their own memorials, approximately 130 across the 50 states as of this writing. Both privately and publicly funded, they are varied in size and design, placed in front of high schools, in public parks, at colleges and universities. With the future national monument in mind, this past Memorial Day weekend I set out to visit a few of them, to see whether they might shed some light on how to memorialize wars that haven\u2019t ended, and might never.\n* * *\nI arrive on a muggy Friday afternoon at the Old North Church in Boston\u2019s North End, made famous by Paul Revere, whose men hung lanterns\u2014\u201cOne if by land, and two if by sea\u201d\u2014from its steepled bell tower. With a guide, I ascend into that same bell tower, which creaks in the wind and boasts commanding views of Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill, as well as dozens of Bostonians sunbathing on their rooftops. As it happens my military career began in Boston, as a naval ROTC midshipman at Tufts University. This was right before the 9/11 attacks, and I had fully expected that I would serve in peacetime.\nThe outbreak of war is often unexpected. As if to reinforce this fact, my guide ushers me from the church\u2019s highest point to its lowest: the crypt, where 1,100 sets of remains are walled into the church\u2019s foundations. Many are British soldiers: The beginning of the Revolution took loyalists by surprise, and the basement of the Old North Church, where the congregation was largely loyal to the British crown, became one of the few places their British protectors could be peacefully interred. As the war dragged on, however, prominent revolutionaries would soon be mixed in among them, including Capt. Samuel Nicholson, the first commander of the USS Constitution , the oldest U.S. naval vessel still afloat, on whose decks I was commissioned a second lieutenant before heading to Iraq.\nWe exit the crypt and come into the light of the back garden, where since 2006 the church has housed a memorial to the fallen of the Iraq and Afghan wars, making it the oldest such memorial in the country. At first, the memorial was humble, a cross or Star of David made from popsicle sticks for each service member killed.\nThese markers proved less than durable, and the congregation soon changed the design to something more lasting. Now six tall posts are planted into the soil, in the shape of a horseshoe. Strung between each pair are wires, and hanging from them are dog tags, giving the effect of a shimmering, semicircular wall. On Saturday mornings, Bruce Brooksbank, a congregant and the memorial\u2019s volunteer coordinator, visits for about two hours. He tends the garden, which is planted with red and white forget-me-nots. In his pocket he carries a few blank dog tags and, after checking iCasualties.org, he adds however many are required. At the time of writing, there are 6,978. When the dog tags catch the light, reflections dance on the ground. Bruce says that the light reminds him of angels, and the chime from the wind passing through them their voices.\nA little girl steps into the garden and reaches for the dog tags. Her mother moves to stop her, but Bruce encourages her to touch them. \u201cHow do you like my garden?\u201d he asks. Children are his favorite visitors, he explains. They arrive without political or historical preconceptions; they aren\u2019t pro-war or antiwar; they didn\u2019t vote for Bush or for Kerry. Their reaction is pure. Though they may not understand something as abstract as a pair of never-ending wars, they respond to the experience of seeing what\u2019s been built here at the Old North Church.\nThe memorial is on a slight rise beside a brick pathway, and most of its visitors seem to happen upon it. When they learn what it is, they appear almost startled. In the hour that I sit with Bruce, nearly everyone who comes along slows to consider it. One young man, maybe a college student, strolls past wearing a tank top, khaki shorts, flip-flops and electric green plastic sunglasses. He stops and stares up at the memorial as though it\u2019s a mountain he has yet to summit. Then he breaks down crying. He looks up at the monument a second time, and then breaks down again. The outburst is quick, less than a minute. Then he leaves.\nWhen I ask Bruce if he has thoughts about a design for the national monument, he says, \u201cThrough simplicity you have power.\u201d\n* * *\nBattleship Memorial Park sits on 175 acres at the northern tip of Mobile Bay, where the World War II-era USS Alabama rests at anchor. Scattered across the park\u2019s acreage, as though staged for an invasion, is an impressive array of vintage military hardware. Calamity Jane , a retired B-52 Stratofortress, is installed next to where I\u2019ve parked my rental car; it\u2019s one of many long-range bombers that dropped its tonnage of explosives on North Vietnam. Its night camouflage is tattooed with red bomblets near the cockpit, each one designating a successful combat mission.\nI\u2019ve flown down to Mobile to see the Fallen Hero 9/11 Memorial, honoring Alabamians killed in service since 9/11, in whose shadow I\u2019m now standing with Nathan Cox. Before joining the Marines, Nathan played fullback for the University of Alabama, where he also graduated summa cum laude. He\u2019s got a bad knee from the football; sometimes it locks up on him. \u201cWhile I was in the Corps, it got a lot worse,\u201d he says, stretching out the leg.\nNathan, who like me was an infantry officer\u2014in fact, we served in the same division within a year of each other in Iraq\u2014led the initiative to erect this memorial, which was dedicated on September 11, 2015. \u201cThis memorial,\u201d he says, \u201cis just us trying to say something good.\u201d\nThe centerpiece of the monument, designed by a local artist named Casey Downing Jr., also a veteran, is a stout, flat-topped black granite hexagonal base on top of which is a bronze replica of combat boots, a helmet and dog tags arrayed around a rifle bayoneted into the granite. Historically, to mark the location of fallen soldiers on the battlefield, their comrades would bayonet a rifle into the dirt. This has evolved into a traditional symbol honoring fallen soldiers. I remember the horseshoe of 21 boots, helmets, dog tags and rifles at our infantry battalion\u2019s final memorial service.\nEngraved on one side of the monument are the names of the Alabamians killed in these wars, with space, of course, for future additions. On each of the other five sides hangs a bronze bas-relief honoring a service member in his or her dress uniform from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force and Coast Guard. Twin brick pathways, a shade darker than the brickwork surrounding the monument, lead from the back of the monument like shadows to a pair of rectangular black granite towers, representing the World Trade Center\u2019s twin towers, standing side by side at about eight feet tall, and etched with a narrative describing the events of September 11 and the subsequent \u201cGlobal War on Terror.\u201d The text concludes with a quote attributed to George Orwell:\nPeople sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because\nrough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\nNathan, who joined the Corps in response to the 9/11 attacks, and is now a successful real estate developer, spent eight years raising the half-million dollars needed to build the memorial from private donations. \u201cAlabama\u2019s such a patriotic place,\u201d he says, holding his restless son, Luke, who squirms in his arms. \u201cEverywhere you asked,\u201d he adds, \u201cpeople wanted to help.\u201d\nWe stand together considering his memorial. \u201cYou know, when it was time for our generation\u2019s war, I just wanted to be there,\u201d he says. It is late in the afternoon, time for him to take his son home, and when he walks back to his truck, I notice that he limps a bit.\n* * *\nThe next morning, a Sunday, I head north. The highway runs over the water and then across the marshlands that feed into Mobile Bay. I take on elevation, eventually entering Tennessee, where a half-hour outside of Nashville, in Murfreesboro, I stop to have dinner at a Cracker Barrel before settling into a motel room nearby.\nThroughout the drive, I\u2019ve been swapping text messages with Colby Reed, a former Marine corporal and Afghan war veteran who\u2019s from the area. Colby has volunteered to take me to the local war memorial in Murfreesboro. We make plans to have breakfast the following morning. I ask him to recommend a place, and he suggests the Cracker Barrel, so I\u2019m back there the next morning. It\u2019s Monday\u2014Memorial Day.\nThe place is packed, but Colby stands out as he makes his way through the crowd toward my table. He\u2019s still in good shape, with broad shoulders, and he wears an olive drab T-shirt from his old unit, Third Battalion, Eighth Marine Regiment. He\u2019s brought his wife with him. She\u2019s in law school. He was a cop until recently and is now teaching criminal justice in high school while enrolled in college himself.\nColby enlisted in the Marines at 17, in 2009. When I ask him why, he says, \u201c9/11.\u201d When I point out to Colby that this seems like a rather dramatic reaction for a 9-year-old to have had, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma around millennials, but people forget that millennials fought America\u2019s longest wars as volunteers.\u201d\nI was born in 1980, which is supposed to make me a millennial, but I\u2019ve never felt like one. I mentioned this once to a friend of mine about my age, a former bomb technician who also fought in Iraq. He said he\u2019d never felt like a millennial either, so he\u2019d come up with a different generational criterion: If you were old enough to have an adult reaction to the September 11 attacks, you\u2019re not a millennial.\nSo maybe I\u2019m not a millennial after all, and maybe Colby isn\u2019t one either. At 9 years old he decided to enlist, and eight years later he went through with it, convincing his parents to sign an age waiver. Wars, which were once shared as generational touchstones, are no longer experienced the same way in this country because of our all-volunteer military. I\u2019ve often wondered: In the past, did this make the return home less jarring? Maybe so. I\u2019d rather be part of a lost generation, I think, than be the lost part of a generation.\nAfter breakfast, we go to the Rutherford County Courthouse, in the Murfreesboro square, quintessential small-town America. Colby jokes how much the courthouse and the square resemble the set of Back to the Future . On the southeast corner of the courthouse green is the memorial, dedicated in 1948 by the local chapter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Admittedly, it isn\u2019t much: five conjoined granite slabs of varying heights with names and places chiseled into the stone. Because it\u2019s Memorial Day, a few roses have been left at the base. Across the slabs is engraved: THESE OUR WAR DEAD IN HONORED GLORY REST.\nWhat we see is plain and unadorned. Unlike the dog tags refashioned as wind chimes in the Memorial Garden in Boston, nothing about this memorial is conceptual. Unlike the Fallen Hero 9/11 Memorial in Mobile, it isn\u2019t grand or triumphant. This memorial is quiet, straightforward, conveying only the essentials. What else is there to say?\nColby stares at the names of five Murfreesboro native sons killed in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014his wife went to high school with one of the guys\u2014along with dozens of names from the First World War, Second World War, Korea and Vietnam. Colby is aware of the story that I\u2019m writing, and that nobody knows what the memorial on the National Mall will be like, which is why without prompting he says, \u201cIf they just gave us a little piece of land. A wall with our names. That\u2019d be enough.\u201d\n* * *\nOften, since coming home, I\u2019ve had strangers tell me they can\u2019t imagine what I went through. These comments are always made with kindness, with deference and sympathy; but I have always found them disempowering. If somebody can\u2019t imagine what I went through, it means I\u2019ve had experiences that have changed me and yet have made part of me fundamentally unknowable, even inaccessible, and disconnected from the person I was before. If that\u2019s the case, it means I never truly get to return home: I am forever cut off from the person I was before these wars.\nWhy do we build these memorials anyway? We do it to honor the dead, of course. We do it so veterans and their families will have a place to gather and remember. But there\u2019s something else, a less obvious reason but one I would say is most important. If a memorial is effective, if it\u2019s done well, anyone should be able to stand in front of it and, staring up, feel something of what I felt when my friend J.P. Blecksmith, 24, from Pasadena, was killed by a sniper in Fallujah on Veterans Day, 2004, or when Garrett Lawton, his wife and two young sons back home in North Carolina, was killed by an IED in Herat Province, Afghanistan. If civilians can feel that ache\u2014even a fraction of it\u2014they might start to imagine what it was like for us. And if they can imagine that, we come home.\n* * *\nA week after Memorial Day, I find myself on the phone with Michael \u201cRod\u201d Rodriguez, who leads the nonprofit Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, which is responsible for overseeing the fund-raising, design and construction of the national memorial, which is currently scheduled for completion in 2024. The foundation, Rod tells me, plans to have an open competition for the design, as was done with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. After a few minutes, Rod mentions that he served with Seventh Special Forces Group in Afghanistan. So did I. It turns out that we share many friends, and our interview is quickly derailed as we begin swapping war stories. I try to get us back on topic by asking him the purpose of the new memorial. \u201cWhat we were just doing,\u201d Rod replies. \u201cTalking about old times, remembering . It saves lives.\u201d\nRod emails me a map of the National Mall with about a half-dozen potential sites for the memorial, which will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, whose mission is to protect the dignity of public space in the nation\u2019s capital. Although real estate on the National Mall is precious, as of this writing four other war memorials are being planned for its grounds, commemorating the First World War, the Gulf War, Native American veterans and African-Americans who fought in the Revolution. And this doesn\u2019t include a planned expansion of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which will add an underground visitors\u2019 center, and the addition of a wall to the Korean War Veterans Memorial etched with the names of the 36,000 service members killed in that conflict.\nThe pace of construction on the Mall over the last three decades is remarkable, particularly considering that for the first 200 years of our nation\u2019s history\u2014which included nine major wars\u2014not a single major war memorial existed on the Mall. What a society chooses to commemorate says a great deal about that society. Most of our national memorials are dedicated to our wars. Which raises a question: Is the National Mall turning into a kind of symbolic national graveyard?\nOf course, one can certainly argue for the central role of these memorials in our capital, because none of our other accomplishments are possible without the freedom that our military has assured. But you need look no further than your own reflection in the shiny black granite of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to understand that many of our wars are self-inflicted wounds.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that we should commemorate only \u201cmorally good\u201d wars, such as the Civil War or the Second World War. Those might be the conflicts we least need reminding of. It\u2019s the more problematic wars in Vietnam, Korea, and, yes, Iraq and Afghanistan we need to memorialize in the most prominent spaces, lest future generations, while celebrating our successes, forget our mistakes.\n* * *\nSeth Moulton, a friend from the Marines, is now a congressman representing Massachusetts\u2019 Sixth District. Along with Representative Mike Gallagher, from Wisconsin, Seth was an original sponsor of the bipartisan Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act. I got in touch with Seth in Washington, D.C. and, with the memorial\u2019s potential sites saved to my phone, we set out for a run on the Mall.\nWe meet in front of the Longworth House Office Building early on a Wednesday morning. It\u2019s late July, muggy and hot. Seth wears an old desert-brown Under Armour shirt from his Iraq days. We jog west on the south side of the Mall, skirting the vast lawn along with the other joggers as we progress toward the Lincoln Memorial. Seth asks which of the memorials on my trip had resonated the most, and I confess that perhaps it was Murfreesboro: There was something honest about the places and names etched into stone. \u201cA memorial like that isn\u2019t really open to interpretation,\u201d I say.\nWe huff past the World War II Memorial, with its swooping eagles clutching laurels in their talons and epic bas-reliefs conveying the drama of a vast struggle fought across continents. \u201cIn another life,\u201d says Seth, \u201cI would have liked to have been an architect.\u201d\nI ask him how he would design the Global War on Terrorism Memorial.\n\u201cIt should be something that begins with idealistic goals, and then spins off into a quagmire,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will need to be a memorial that can remain endless, as a tribute to an endless war.\u201d\nA memorial to an endless war is an interesting prospect. It\u2019s been said that war is a phenomenon like other inevitable, destructive forces in nature\u2014fires, hurricanes\u2014although war is, of course, a part of human nature. Perhaps for the right artist, it will be an opportunity to make the truest war memorial possible, a monument to this fault in our nature.\nIf I had my way, I would get rid of all the war memorials and combine them into a single black wall of reflective granite, like Maya Lin\u2019s design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I\u2019d place the wall around the Reflecting Pool, beneath the long shadows of the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, the wall descending into the earth like something out of Dante. Etched into the wall would be names, and the very first would be Crispus Attucks, a black freeman shot dead by redcoats at the Boston Massacre, not far from the Old North Church. From there the wall would slope downward, each death taking it deeper into the earth, the angle of its descent defined by 1.3 million names, our nation\u2019s cumulative war dead.\nThe wall itself would be endless. When a new war began, we wouldn\u2019t erect a new monument. We wouldn\u2019t have debates about real estate on the Mall. Instead we\u2019d continue our descent. (If there\u2019s one thing you learn in the military, it\u2019s how to dig into the earth.) Deeper and deeper our wars would take us. To remember the fresh dead, we would have to walk past all the ones who came before. The human cost would be forever displayed in one monumental place, as opposed to scattered disconnectedly across the Mall.\nThe memorial would have a real-world function, too: Imagine if Congress passed legislation ensuring that every time a president signed a troop deployment order, he or she would have to descend into this pit. There, beside the very last name\u2014the person most recently killed in defense of this country or its interests\u2014there would be a special pen, nothing fancy, but this pen would be the only pen by law that could sign such an order.\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m picturing as Seth and I arrive at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\u201cRun to the top?\u201d I ask him.\n\u201cNot all the way,\u201d he says, \u201cjust two-thirds,\u201d explaining that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s right to jog on such hallowed ground. We wander inside the vestibule. Seth grows quiet. When I ask if he wants to continue our run, my voice echoes against the stone.\nSoon we\u2019re back outside, running down the stairs. \u201cI love the Lincoln,\u201d Seth says as we head east, toward the Capitol and past the memorials for Korea and for Vietnam. We talk about what our memorial will mean, the effect we hope it will have on our generation of veterans, and how we hope that one day we\u2019ll be able to take our children to a memorial that conveys with sufficient emotion the experience not only of our war, but of war itself.\nOn our left we pass a duck pond. A layer of green sludge, maybe a centimeter thick, coats its surface. A dozen or so ducks, a squad\u2019s worth, paddle through a quagmire of slime. One at a time they follow each other into the sludge and then determinedly try to keep together as they cross. A few seem stuck. We watch them as we run past.

Additionally, cheaper and modified chickens carry significantly more fat than protein in their bodies, which could also affect the price difference between different cuts of meat.", "references": ["Americans\u2019 demand for cheap meat has forced factory-farm broiler chickens to grow faster and larger than ever before\nShare\nFresh from the trauma of World War II, mid-century Americans imagined a peaceful, prosperous future. They dreamed of moon rockets and flying cars. They envisioned house-cleaning robots. And, after years of rationing, they hoped for bountiful meals. Most particularly, they hungered for chicken. But not the scrawny, spent laying hens, exhausted from their lives producing eggs, that Americans ate when beef and pork were scarce. Instead, they looked forward to the bird of the future\u2014bigger, better.\nThe A&P grocery chain invited poultry producers to enter a nationwide contest. Farmers sent eggs from their plumpest birds to a U.S. Department of Agriculture station on Maryland\u2019s eastern shore. Researchers selected and bred birds who were larger and faster-growing to create a new type of chicken, \u201ca broad-breasted bird with bigger drumsticks, plumper thighs and layers of white meat,\u201d according to writer and broadcaster Lowell Thomas, who narrated a documentary sponsored by Texaco. It would be, proclaimed the film\u2019s title, \u201cThe Chicken of Tomorrow.\u201d\nOver decades, America got all that and more.\nAs the winning chicks, hatched in 1948, were used to breed the strains now used by large-scale commercial farms, the time needed to raise a \u201cbroiler\u201d\u2014a chicken raised for meat\u2014dropped from 12 weeks to six or less, the feed required fell by half and the growth rate multiplied by four. The amount of breast meat on an individual bird rose by nearly 70 %. By 1978, a pound of chicken, which in 1922 had cost around $5.50 in today\u2019s dollars, cost just $2.46. Per capita, chicken consumption grew four-fold, and a whole new industry emerged, dominated by factory farms controlled by corporations such as Tyson and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride.\nA recent paper shows the consequences: Scientists at a research farm in Alberta that has continued to breed earlier strains of chickens took pictures of a 1956 type broiler, a 1978 broiler and a 2005 broiler, all 8 weeks old, and placed the photos side by side. The result is unsettling: On the left, a comparatively fit bird (1956), in the center a plump chicken (1978) who appears \u201cnormal\u201d (if you don\u2019t know how chickens used to look), and on the right, the \u201cchicken of tomorrow,\u201d a morbidly obese bird (2005) who appears monstrous next to the others. By modern standards, she\u2019s a week or two past the date when she would be slaughtered for meat and she\u2019s at high risk for heart failure. She\u2019s a juvenile, but the size of her body has outgrown the capacity of her bones and joints, muscles and organs to support it, says John Webster, professor emeritus of animal husbandry at the University of Bristol.\n\u201cIf [broilers] weren\u2019t killed at 42 days, they wouldn\u2019t survive another two weeks,\u201d he says.\nBroilers are the only livestock that are in chronic pain for the last 20 percent of their lives. They don't move around much\u2026 because it hurts their joints so much.\nJohn Webster, Professor Emeritus at the University of Bristol\nDuring the last days of their lives, about a third of broiler chickens suffer leg problems so severe they struggle to walk. Factory-farm workers move through buildings to collect dead birds and break the necks of lame ones. Survivors huddle on the floor, trapped by their own bodies. Unable to escape the pain, they lie in litter strewn with their own waste. Ammonia burns their breasts and often blisters their skin and feet.\nIn 2016, the HSUS launched a campaign to end these kinds of conditions. In June, Perdue became the first major producer to commit to reform. Major buyers followed.\nThe initiative comes after years of research have documented the suffering produced by the birds\u2019 genetics. Before joining the HSUS-affiliate Humane Society International, Sara Shields studied whether farmers could encourage broilers to dustbathe and improve their welfare through increased exercise. But she found that because of their size, dustbathing was not enough and by the time the birds approached the market weight they did not engage in much behavior beyond sitting and eating.\nWhat has taken place is the opposite of Darwinian selection, Webster says, \u201cThey\u2019ve destroyed the fitness of the bird in order to produce the most meat.\u201d\nWith approximately 9 billion broilers raised and slaughtered each year in the U.S. alone (60 billion worldwide), Webster calls the broiler industry the single greatest example of human inhumanity toward another animal. It\u2019s why Shields chose chickens as the subject of her doctoral dissertation.\n\u201cIf an animal only has six weeks to live, it\u2019s really important that they have a positive experience,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got\u2014six weeks.\u201d\nBut to improve quality of life, breeders must change broiler genetics so birds grow more slowly and can live longer, Webster, Shields and other experts say. Fortunately, breeders still have small supplies of slower-growing chicks that can be used to reform the industry. In the United Kingdom, grocery stores competing for customers are already selling birds that take 10 weeks to reach market weight. In the United States, at the urging of the HSUS and other animal welfare groups, producers and buyers are beginning to shift toward this. There is also hope that researchers can eventually breed a faster-growing bird that is healthy and walks without pain.\nThe HSUS has worked with Perdue, one of the country\u2019s largest producers, to develop a reform plan that includes changing the type of broilers farmers raise and offering birds more room. Late in 2016, the five largest food service companies in the country, which together buy more than 115 million chickens a year\u2014Compass Group, Sodexo, Aramark, Delaware North and Centerplate\u2014announced with the HSUS that by 2024 they will adopt a new Global Animal Partnership standard for healthier breeds of chickens, better living conditions and increased space per bird.\nStarbucks and Panera Bread have announced a similar policy. Aside from ensuring better lives for the chickens, the companies are also mandating a slaughter method that avoids excessively inhumane practices and instead uses a multistep controlled-atmosphere processing system that renders chickens unconscious so they suffer less.\nJosh Balk, the HSUS vice president of farm animal protection, says the organization is meeting with other major companies. \u201cIt will take years to make these changes happen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to start now.\u201d\nModern broilers are raised in starkly different ways: Factory farms stock the fastest-growing birds, while some smaller farms let slower-growing birds roam outside. As the HSUS transforms the industry, bigger farms will switch to healthier birds able to lead better lives, even if they are still indoors.\nWalk into one of the windowless, dimly lit factory farms where most U.S. broilers are raised, and you\u2019re likely to see tens of thousands of obese birds, barely stirring, sitting on the floor in their own waste. They have been selected for massive appetites, bred to eat and sit. Many of the birds have painful leg and joint problems that make walking difficult. They\u2019re confined so close together that they jostle one another. This, plus the absence of a natural light-dark cycle, prevents sleep, which is critical for young, growing animals. It\u2019s a scene of quiet misery. There\u2019s a stench of ammonia. The birds\u2019 bodies are on the brink of giving out. So extreme is the stress that in order for breeder broilers to survive long enough to lay eggs (about 20 weeks), producers must restrict their feed intake, sometimes feeding them only every other day. Broilers raised to be eaten usually die at 6 weeks, says Shields. \u201cThey still peep like baby chicks when they\u2019re slaughtered.\u201d\nThe chickens at White Oaks Pastures, owned by the HSUS state agriculture advisory council member Will Harris in Bluffton, Georgia, are very different because of their genetics, behavior and environment. Place a factory farm broiler outside to forage for food and move with a flock, and that chicken probably would not survive, Harris says. Using chicks who genetically resemble birds from the 1950s, Harris puts his birds out on pasture to do what chickens evolved to: search out insects and other edible morsels by scratching the soil, all the while fertilizing dirt with their manure. They walk miles each day before they roost in mobile houses that are towed to different spots. At 12 weeks, they reach 3 to 4 pounds and are slaughtered on the farm. The price consumers pay, via the White Oak Pastures website, is around $4 per pound\u2014more than three times what conventional chicken meat costs. It\u2019s a struggle to find people to spend that, says Harris, who has turned a profit with pasture-raised cows and pigs but not so far with chickens: \u201cConsumers will either support humane production, and it will thrive, or they will not, and it will perish.\u201d\nThe HSUS is encouraging producers to breed healthier broilers who live free from pain and engage in typical chicken behaviors\u2014in other words, to be like chickens were until the push for maximum efficiency altered their genetic makeup. Given a modest increase in space (at least 1 square foot per six pounds of animal) along with more natural light, better litter quality and hay bales, their lives will be substantially altered. They will walk around, dust bathe, peck and perch. For the birds, a lifetime of misery will be turned into an existence that allows for a little bit of pleasure. Webster, the professor in the U.K., has seen it happen. Chickens there live in conditions that allow them to demonstrate their intelligence and engaging personalities. When a human visitor arrives, they rush forward to greet him. \u201cThe big movement is to get a better bird,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got a better bird, you can give it a better life.\u201d\nFollow the work of the Farm Animal Protection campaign.

Kidney swelling happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result. This can occur from a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys (ureters) or from an anatomical defect that doesn't allow urine to drain properly.\nHydronephrosis can happen at any age. Hydronephrosis in children may be diagnosed during infancy or sometimes during a prenatal ultrasound before the baby is born.\nHydronephrosis doesn't always cause symptoms. When they occur, signs and symptoms of hydronephrosis might include:\n- Pain in the side and back that may travel to the lower abdomen or groin\n- Urinary problems, such as pain with urination or feeling an urgent or frequent need to urinate\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Fever\n- Failure to thrive, in infants\nTypically, urine passes from the kidney through a tube called a ureter that drains into the bladder, and then out of the body. But, sometimes urine backs up or remains inside the kidney or in the ureter. That's when hydronephrosis can develop.\nSome common causes of hydronephrosis include:\n- Partial blockage in the urinary tract. Urinary tract blockages often form where the kidney meets the ureter. Less commonly, blockages may occur where the ureter meets the bladder.\n- Vesicoureteral reflux. Vesicoureteral reflux happens when urine flows backward through the ureter from the bladder up into the kidney. Typically, urine flows only one way in the ureter. Urine flowing the wrong way makes it difficult for the kidney to empty properly and causes the kidney to swell.\nLess-common causes of hydronephrosis include kidney stones, a tumor in the abdomen or pelvis, and problems with nerves that lead to the bladder.\nYour health care provider may refer you to a doctor who specializes in conditions affecting the urinary system (urologist) for your diagnosis.\nTests for diagnosing hydronephrosis may include:\n- A blood test to evaluate kidney function\n- A urine test to check for signs of infection or urinary stones that could cause a blockage\n- An ultrasound imaging exam, during which your doctor can view the kidneys, bladder and other urinary structures to identify potential problems\n- A specialized X-ray of the urinary tract that uses a special dye to outline the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra, capturing images before and during urination\nIf necessary, your doctor may recommend additional imaging exams, such as a CT scan or MRI. Another possibility is a test called a MAG3 scan that evaluates function and drainage in the kidney.\nTreatment for hydronephrosis depends on the underlying cause. Although surgery is sometimes needed, hydronephrosis often resolves on its own.\n- Mild to moderate hydronephrosis.

While much of it focuses on the economic costs and benefits of migration in both recipient and sending countries, much less is known about the human side of the migration story. Most of what we know is based on anecdotal stories, such as a disproportionate focus on a visible crime committed by one immigrant, or heart-wrenching tales of what happens to illegal migrants who fail to reach their intended destinations. While these stories are important, they are not based on sufficiently large-scale and representative data that can inform the policy debate. Our new research uses worldwide data to focus on a little known story: what happens to the families of migrants who are left behind.\nInternational migrants often leave their family members behind in the origin country, because it is costly for the whole family to move or because of strict immigration policies and uncertain conditions in the places they are going. Migrants often send home money (i.e., remittances) that benefit those left behind by increasing their consumption and improving their living conditions. At the same time, migration disrupts family life, which could have negative effects on the well-being of migrant-sending households living in the countries of origin. Previous work shows that migration could increase both the incomes and happiness levels of those who move. Yet how does the out-migration of family members affect the well-being of family members left behind in the country of origin? We explore this question in a recent paper , published in the Journal of Population Economics .\nAcademics and policymakers alike have increasingly included subjective measures of well-being in their arsenal of tools to assess the causes and consequences of complex processes such as migration. Subjective well-being relates to the notion ordinary people are the best judges of how their lives are going. Unsurprisingly, governments around the world are complementing objective welfare metrics with subjective well-being outcomes such as life satisfaction and happiness to assess individual welfare and societal progress and guide policymaking . In the context of our study, subjective measures allow us to draw a fuller picture of the effects of emigration on migrant family members staying behind than by simply looking at their consumption, income, or labor market participation.\nThe current evidence on the well-being consequences of emigration for those staying behind at the origin countries primarily comes from one-country studies in low- or lower-middle-income origin countries. Our paper fills this knowledge gap by studying a wide range of origin countries, including high-income countries, and by using several subjective well-being dimensions, which has not been done before. We further distinguish between hedonic (i.e., affective) and cognitive (i.e., evaluative) dimensions of subjective well-being . Positive hedonic well-being is about feelings such as joy and happiness at a particular point in time. Negative hedonic well-being includes experiences of stress, anger, sadness, or worry at a particular point in time. By contrast, evaluative well-being usually reflects people\u2019s capabilities, means, and long-term opportunities, based on questions that ask respondents to evaluate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10.\nWe use data from the Gallup World Poll , which includes several subjective well-being questions and information on whether the respondent has household members abroad and whether the respondent\u2019s family receives help in the form of money or goods from abroad. We analyze 144,003 left behind individuals living in 114 countries during 2009-2010 and uncover both the common trends in a set of varied countries and differences across country groups.\nWe find that having family members abroad is associated with higher levels of life satisfaction and with positive effect among the left behind, and that receiving remittances is linked with even greater increases in life satisfaction, especially in poorer contexts\u2014both across and within countries. Specifically, remittance receipt corresponds to a 2 percent increase in life satisfaction (evaluated at the sample mean of life satisfaction of 5.495) (see Figure 1). As we explain in the paper, this result is likely due to the improvements in living standards or the different social status remittance-receiving families could have in the community. The additional well-being influence coming from having relatives abroad is about the same size of that of the well-being effect of remittances. This may reflect that those left behind may derive satisfaction or joy from knowing that their family members realize their potential abroad. Having a family member living in a different country could also increase the future chances of moving abroad for the left-behinds. We find similar results for positive affect: simply put, the daily experiences of happiness of the left behinds seem to improve. Thus, the out-migration of family members influences both life evaluations and positive emotions through an income channel (remittances) and a residual psychological channel (having relatives abroad).\nYet at the same time, we discover that having household members abroad is associated with increased stress and depression for the left-behinds, and remittances do not offset these conditions. Figure 2 illustrates this point. At the same time, however, remittances are statistically unassociated with stress and depression as the error band around these estimates crosses the 0-line, suggesting that the stress and depression consequences of remittances are indistinguishable from zero. Taken together, Figures 1 and 2 show that while remittances \u201cbuy happiness,\u201d they do not relieve the pain of separation.\nWe also find that the out-migration of family members appears less traumatic in countries where migration is more common, which also tend to be poorer, indicating that people in such contexts are used to coping with separation. Migrant-sending households in low-income countries often gather in informal groups to help each other to share information or when preparing for migration. But receiving remittances in high-income countries is linked with depression experiences, possibly because getting money from relatives abroad in prosperous countries with relatively generous welfare systems is a marker of destitution or disadvantage and, as such, also leads to depression. Thus, in countries where emigration is less common, such as in richer countries, there is room for policies to mitigate the negative experiences of stress and depression for vulnerable groups of household members staying behind through encouraging formal or informal support groups and stress and depression prevention programs."], "citation_links": ["https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/09/13/international-migration-what-happens-to-those-left-behind/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_d65738ff-01c9-43f5-a903-74d9020c7571"}

In contrast to the benefits of sleep, frameworks exploring the impact of sleep loss are relatively lacking. Importantly, the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) do not simply reflect the absence of sleep and the benefits attributed to it; rather, they reflect the consequences of several additional factors, including extended wakefulness. With a focus on neuroimaging studies, we review the consequences of SD on attention and working memory, positive and negative emotion, and hippocampal learning. We explore how this evidence informs our mechanistic understanding of the known changes in cognition and emotion associated with SD, and the insights it provides regarding clinical conditions associated with sleep disruption.\nWithout sleep, our cognitive and emotional abilities become markedly disrupted. What are the neural changes underlying these abnormalities? What do these alterations tell us about the pervasive link between sleep disruption and numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders?\nThere are at least three motivating reasons to build an accurate account of how sleep deprivation (SD) affects the human brain. First, from a neurobiological perspective, it is important to characterize which networks in the human brain are vulnerable or resilient to the effects of insufficient sleep and to understand how such SD-induced changes (such as regional or network increases or decreases in activity or changes in functional connectivity) explain the maladaptive changes in behaviour that are associated with SD. Of importance, SD does not simply represent the absence of sleep and the functions attributed to it. Rather, the sleep-deprived state is a composite of numerous detrimental factors, including extended wakefulness, as well as the absence of sleep. It is therefore insufficient only to develop an understanding of the functional benefits of sleep and then to reverse-infer an understanding of the neural and behavioural changes that would be expected following a lack thereof. Second, it is necessary to determine how comorbid sleep disruption \u2014 present in all major neurological and psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease, anxiety disorders and addiction disorders 1 , 2 \u2014 contributes to or results from these disorders and may thus be a target for disease treatment and/or prevention. Third, from a societal standpoint, such scientific evidence informs debates regarding sleep recommendations for both public and professional health policies in light of the acknowledged sleep-loss epidemic that now pervades industrialized nations 3 .\nThis Review seeks to move closer to these goals. We provide a focused overview of the impact of SD on the human brain across five functional domains: attention; working memory; positive, reward-related affect; negative affect; and hippocampus-dependent memory. Drawing on neuroimaging studies, we explore the neural signatures underlying phenotypic changes in cognition and affect following experimental SD. Moreover, we present examples of how these findings afford mechanistic insights into clinical disorders associated with disturbed sleep. The Review is necessarily focused on acute (24\u201348-hour) SD unless otherwise specified, as most neuroimaging studies to date are restricted to these time frames. Nevertheless, the issue of acute versus chronic sleep loss is discussed in more detail in BOX 1 .\nA well-characterized feature of both acute sleep deprivation (SD) and chronic partial sleep restriction is a dose-dependent effect on task performance, especially in the domain of attention. The greater the amount and/or the longer duration of SD, the worse the accumulating attention deficit 6 . Thus, attentional impairment may be strongly coupled with extended wakefulness and with sleep pressure. These objectively measured impairments in performance are distinct from increases in subjective ratings of sleepiness following SD, which depend on the form of SD applied; for example, sleepiness increases as acute SD continues but does not always increase as chronic sleep restriction continues 5 . Thus, the physiological response to sleep loss may depend to some degree on the form of SD.\nRegardless, the brain processes that mediate these cumulative deficits remain largely uncharacterized. For example, is there a brain region or set of brain regions involved in, or associated with, the tracking of sleep pressure 131 , or are there processes that track sleep pressure locally in a use-dependent manner within individual neuronal ensembles 132 ? Sleep pressure-related molecules, such as adenosine, and the hypothalamic system governing the switch mechanism between sleep and wake 133 are logical candidates for the chemical signalling and network mediation of this prototypical dose-dependent attentional impairment with sleep loss. In humans, neuroimaging analysis has revealed that association cortices, especially in the frontoparietal attention network, are particularly sensitive to sleep pressure, whereas subcortical thalamic and basal ganglia brain regions seem to be more affected by circadian processes 19 .\nA second behavioural feature of SD that is poorly defined at the whole-brain level is a phenotypic difference in vulnerability to SD-associated cognitive impairments 134 \u2013 138 . Approximately one third of participants show minimal impairments in sustained attention under SD conditions, and this seems to be a reliable, stable trait. By contrast, one third of participants manifest a severely vulnerable phenotype, showing marked attentional impairments. Moreover, it seems that differential vulnerability to the effects of acute sleep loss on attention is, in part, heritable 137 . Adding further complexity, the extent of an individual\u2019s cognitive impairment also depends on which cognitive domain is tested 130 . Thus, although performance impairments following SD within any given cognitive domain are highly reliable within the same individual, the degree of impairment is not necessarily reliable across cognitive domains within the same individual. The underlying brain correlates that differentiate these stable intra-individual and inter-individual differences are unclear, but the functional integrity of the frontoparietal attention network and genetic influences on sleep and circadian regulation are probably key factors 139 , 140 .\nOne cognitive ability that is especially susceptible to sleep loss is attention, which serves ongoing goal-directed behaviour 4 . Performance on attentional tasks deteriorates in a dose-dependent manner with the amount of accrued time awake, owing to increasing sleep pressure 5 \u2013 7 . The prototypic impairments on such tasks are known as \u2018lapses\u2019 or \u2018microsleeps\u2019, which involve response failures that reflect errors of omission 4 \u2013 6 . More specifically, attentional maintenance becomes highly variable and erratic (with attention being sustained, lost, reestablished, then lost again), resulting in unstable task performance 4 . Although the focus of this Review is sleep loss, it should be noted that daytime circadian alerting signals interact with SD, resulting in exponentially scaling attentional impairment with extended wakefulness (for reviews, see REFS 7 , 8 ). Nevertheless, the cumulative amount of extended time spent awake predicts lapses in attention with acute SD and with chronic partial sleep restriction (the latter occurring across many nights) 5 ( BOX 1 ). Why some individuals are more or less vulnerable to these attentional impairments following SD than others is less well understood.\nAn increasingly clear picture is emerging of how brain function related to attentional tasks is altered by acute SD. Reductions in functional MRI (fMRI) signal in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and intraparietal sulcus while performing attentional tasks are a robust and reliable consequence of SD 9 \u2013 16 ( FIG. 1 ). Indeed, sleep loss not only decreases task-related activity in these frontal and parietal regions but also diminishes activity in, and connectivity with, the extrastriate visual cortex during visuospatial attention tasks 9 \u2013 11 . The behavioural consequences of these neural changes are reflected in deficiencies in attending to one specific stimulus while ignoring distractors 10 , 11 , 17 or deficits in top-down allocation of attentional resources, such as orienting to a location where a target is expected to appear 9 , 18 . Beyond attentional focus at any particular moment, sleep loss impairs the capacity to sustain attention over time 4 . Here again, reductions in activity in the DLPFC and intraparietal sulcus contribute to attentional performance failure 11 \u2013 15 , 19 .\na | Brain regions and networks associated with attention and working memory (frontoparietal network (FPN); red), arousal (thalamus; green) and the default mode network (DMN; blue) are affected by sleep deprivation. The DMN is a collection of brain areas, including midline frontoparietal regions, that often disengage when an individual performs an externally driven, goal-directed task and then re-engage when an individual stops performing that task. Suppression of the DMN is necessary to mobilize appropriate on-task brain networks to achieve successful goal-directed behaviour 181 , unless that task requires access to internally stored relevant information such as autobiographical memories or previously learned predictive cues 18 , 182 , 183 . Brain regions across multiple brain networks, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), thalamus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), are differentially altered by sleep loss. b | In the sleep-rested state, there is reciprocal inhibition between task-related FPN activity and DMN activity, supported by sustained ascending arousal input from the thalamus. This leads to consistent attentional and working-memory performance. In the sleep-deprived state, there is unstable reciprocal inhibition between task-related FPN activity and DMN activity, and erratic ascending arousal activity influencing thalamic activity. As a result, there is reduced task-related FPN activity and intermittent intrusions of DMN activity during task engagement. The behavioural consequence is variable and/or impaired attention and working-memory performance, worsening with lowered thalamic activity and improving with higher thalamic activity.\nIn addition, thalamic activity during sustained attention is altered with SD, suggesting that the thalamus could be an interacting node in this SD-affected network. However, the profile of activity change within the thalamus is not uniform. Some studies demonstrated greater activity under conditions of sleep loss 11 , 16 , 20 \u2013 23 , whereas others have reported intermittent periods of diminished thalamic activity 10 , 12 . These discrepancies may be understood in the context of performance and of the cortical arousal that thalamic activity provides. When thalamic activity is elevated under conditions of sleep loss, attentional performance is frequently maintained but, when substantial reductions in thalamic activity are observed, lapses in attention are common 4 , 10 , 12 , 15 . The thalamus therefore represents a pivotal gating hub through which alterations in brainstem ascending arousal signals affect cortical attentional networks under SD conditions. Extant data therefore support a model in which the instability in ascending arousal-promoting input contributes both to the emergence of canonical attentional lapses during SD and the erratic, unpredictable expression of these lapses over time 4 , 24 ( FIG. 1 ). Notably, the observed reductions in thalamic activity are not present during attentional lapses in well-rested conditions 12 , suggesting that increased homeostatic sleep pressure may have a unique role in lapses following SD.\nMore recently, instability of the default mode network (DMN) has been implicated in attentional impairments with SD. Several reports describe an inability to fully disengage midline anterior and posterior cortical regions of the DMN during both selective and sustained attentional task performance under SD conditions 13 , 16 , 25 ( BOX 2 ; FIG. 1 ). Moreover, increased DMN activity during on-task performance for both sustained and selective attention tests was predictive of slower and less accurate performance by the participants 16 , 25 .\nIn addition to inducing differences in task-related brain activity, sleep deprivation (SD) also affects resting-state brain connectivity. Resting-state networks are typically derived from the connectivity profile of spontaneous fluctuations in functional MRI (fMRI) signal and are thought to reflect the brain\u2019s intrinsic functional architecture that emerges without external task demands 141 , 142 . Across these networks, SD is associated with reduced connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal attention network, and the auditory, visual and motor networks 143 \u2013 145 . In fact, measures of abnormal change in whole-brain connectivity enable classification of an individual as either being rested or sleep deprived with more than 60% accuracy 144 .\nOf the many different discrete resting-state networks, the DMN has demonstrated alterations under SD in two specific ways. First, connectivity between individual nodes of the DMN is decreased following one night of total SD 143 , especially between midline anterior and posterior nodes of the DMN 146 . Thus, SD degrades network integrity within the DMN, functionally uncoupling individual nodes. The second consequence of SD is the failure of the DMN to remain functionally distinct from other normally dissociable networks. Under normal rested conditions, the DMN is functionally decoupled from the brain\u2019s attentional networks \u2014 when the latter is engaged, the former is disengaged, and vice versa 147 . Both total SD and partial sleep restriction 122 , 148 \u2013 150 impair this adaptive decoupling, and this impairment is further associated with participants\u2019 cognitive vulnerability to SD 143 .\nThe resting profiles of individual regions, specifically the amygdala and the thalamus, have also been examined following SD 151 , 152 . Similar to task-related connectivity changes (see FIG. 3 ), decreases in resting-state connectivity of the amygdala with regulatory and executive regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex have been demonstrated after 36 hours of SD. Conversely, resting-state connectivity of the amygdala with the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus increases after SD, possibly reflecting the role of these posterior midline cortical regions in regulating the balance between internally and externally directed cognition 153 . Resting-state connectivity between the thalamus and cortical regions is also generally decreased following sleep loss, especially thalamic connectivity with anterior and posterior cingulate regions of the DMN 143 and with attentional and executive regions of the superior and medial prefrontal cortex 151 . As reductions in thalamocortical connectivity have also been demonstrated during sleep onset 154 , it remains possible that resting-state measures in sleep-deprived individuals capture mixed states of sleep and wake, comprising rapid transitions into sleep (known as microsleeps), while some degree of wake-like behavioural responding is nevertheless maintained 155 . This concern is emphasized by reports that have demonstrated reduced functional coupling between midline anterior and posterior nodes of the DMN under conditions of SD and once individuals have entered non-rapid eye movement sleep 156 . Overall, the limited evidence to date suggests that SD triggers reductions in the brain\u2019s intrinsic connectivity profile, ultimately leading to a breakdown of network integrity and a loss of adaptive functional segregation. These alterations may precede or exacerbate changes in task-related responses observed after sleep loss, and might predict the magnitude of cognitive and emotional impairments elicited by SD. A combination of task-related and resting-state fMRI studies of SD seems to be a fruitful avenue for future work, although accurate assessment of sleep or wake states inside the MRI scanner is warranted to assure the absence of microsleeps.\na | Sleep deprivation (SD) amplifies amygdala reactivity (red) in response to negative emotional stimuli and decreases associated amygdala\u2013medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connectivity (blue). b | SD alters sensitivity of the salience-detection network (the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI)) to varying levels of emotional stimuli that range in valence strength ( x axis in the two graphs) from negative (red) to neutral (blue) to positive (red). Under sleep-rested conditions (left graph), there is a wide and dynamic range of salience-detection sensitivity, resulting in the ability to accurately discriminate between degrees of emotional salience (tall vertical difference arrow; discerning emotional (red vertical line) from neutral stimuli (blue vertical line)). By contrast, SD (right graph) is proposed to trigger a narrowing and thus more nonspecific detection sensitivity range, impairing the ability to accurately discriminate between degrees of emotional salience (short vertical difference arrow). This loss of \u2018net neutrality\u2019 results in over-generalized emotional sensitivity, wherein an otherwise largely neutral stimulus (blue vertical line) is inappropriately registered as \u2018emotional\u2019 by the salience-detection network; further observed in biased emotional ratings of neutral stimuli. c | A downstream behavioural consequence of these central brain changes, in combination with disrupted peripheral autonomic nervous system feedback of visceral body information, could lead to inaccurate and even absent outward expression of emotions. This is supported by experimental evidence demonstrating that individuals deprived of sleep fail to register emotional faces shown to them on a screen and consequently are unable to accurately mimic the emotional face expressions of these target faces themselves. Part a is adapted with permission from REF. 81 , Elsevier.\nWhy the sleep-deprived brain suffers this unstable \u2018flip-flop\u2019 gating between on-task functional activity and off-task DMN activity remains unclear. One candidate is abnormal activity of the right frontoinsular cortex, which controls the switch between DMN activity and task-related activity 26 . Consistent with this thesis, the salience-detection network, which includes the frontoinsular cortex, demonstrates reduced activity during the performance of attention tasks following sleep loss 27 . Together with changes in the frontoparietal attention network described above, these insula-based alterations may explain SD-induced impairments in attention to novel, salient targets 28 and in the tracking of salient moving targets 29 . Nevertheless, trial-by-trial analyses of fMRI signal during salience-detection and attention tasks will be required to test this hypothesis.\nWorking memory \u2014 the neural basis of which overlaps anatomically with the attention system \u2014 is also impaired by SD 30 , 31 . Deficits in both working- memory and attention tasks have been found to correlate with reductions in DLPFC and posterior parietal activity 20 \u2013 22 , 32 , 33 . As during attention tasks, fluctuations in thalamic activity 20 \u2013 22 and inappropriate perseverance of DMN activity are observed during working-memory task performance under SD conditions 20 , 21 , 32 . In addition, the degree of aberrant, on-task DMN activity predicts the severity of working-memory impairment in sleep-deprived individuals 20 , 21 , 32 ( FIG. 1 ). Inappropriate gating of on-task relative to off-task network control may therefore provide one common mechanism underlying deficits in both attention and working memory caused by SD.\nAlso mirroring changes observed during attention tasks, alterations in thalamic activity and connectivity predict impairments in working-memory performance under SD conditions, most likely owing to the key role of the thalamus in cortical arousal. For example, increased connectivity between the hippocampus, the thalamus and the DMN predicts higher subjective sleepiness and is associated with worse working-memory performance under sleep-loss conditions 34 , 35 . By contrast, increased connectivity between the thalamus and the precuneus under SD conditions predicts greater recovery of working-memory performance, relative to the sleep-rested state. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the context of SD, the brain exhibits compensatory neural activity that can enable partial recovery of the performance of certain behaviours 34 , 36 .\nBeyond reductions in activity in frontoparietal areas, extrastriate (visual) cortical regions also demonstrate reduced signal during visual working-memory task performance under conditions of sleep loss 21 , 22 , 32 . Recent evidence suggests a causal contribution of this regional decrease in task-related activation to performance deficits, as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeted to the extrastriate cortex of sleep-deprived individuals improved visual working-memory performance, restoring it back to baseline levels 37 , 38 . Remarkably, repeated TMS application every 6 hours for 18 hours to extrastriate regions maintained working-memory performance for up to 3 days without sleep 38 . However, TMS stimulation intervention in the context of SD is not always consistent, and thus the reproducibility of such effects remains unclear 39 . Should a robust method for intervention emerge, it may have real-world relevance \u2014 for example, for professions in which attentive focus is crucial and SD is common (aviation or the military).\nThe mesolimbic reward system is a network of interconnected brain regions, including the midbrain ventral tegmental area, striatum and regions of the PFC. The ventral tegmental area provides dopaminergic innervation to the striatum, which is connected to, and regulated by, areas of the PFC, particularly by the medial PFC (mPFC) and inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) regions, guiding motivated actions and learning. This system has repeatedly been demonstrated to show sensitivity to SD, leading to alterations in motivated behaviours, such as risk taking, sensation seeking and impulsivity ( FIG. 2 ).\na | Reward-relevant brain regions that are affected by sleep deprivation (SD) include cortical regions (blue) such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the subcortical region of the striatum (red). b | Increased adenosine load (blue circles) associated with SD triggers downregulation of dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors (D2/3Rs), resulting in decreased receptor membrane expression within the striatum (internalized receptors; grey). Consequently, there is a greater ratio of D1R to D2/3R availability, and the relative increase in striatal D1R activation by DA (green circles) under SD conditions is proposed to increase risk-related and reward-related approach behaviours, shown in the see-saw imbalance. c | SD further disrupts incentive processing within PFC regions and thus is proposed to result in a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under SD conditions (represented by a narrow dynamic range of PFC sensitivity). This consequentially impairs the ability to accurately map and update changing value or reward probability (coloured dots) over time \u2014 such as that involved in reinforcement learning, ultimately contributing to non-optimal incentive-based decision making.\nIn rats, SD disrupts dopaminergic function by modifying dopamine receptor sensitivity and availability in basal ganglia regions 40 , 41 . Humans deprived of sleep for one night show increases in ventral striatum activity in mixed monetary gamble task during the anticipation and receipt of monetary rewards 42 , 43 . Activity in affect-related regions in the frontal cortex that are associated with valuation and viscerosensory functions, including the insula and mPFC, is also substantially increased following SD 42 , 43 .\nTogether, these findings suggest that subcortical reward-related regions of the brain, together with related cortical regions coding salience and valuation, seem to become hypersensitized by the state of acute SD. However, the degree to which fMRI signal amplitude tracks reward magnitude in these subcortical and cortical regions does not seem to differ between rested and deprived conditions 44 . Rather, SD triggers a generalized increase in reward sensitivity that impairs reward discrimination accuracy, such that the brain becomes less capable of accurately coding incremental increases in reward value, from low to high.\nConsistent with this thesis, fMRI signal in the mPFC, OFC and anterior insula cortex in sleep-deprived individuals does not accurately discriminate between trials involving monetary reward and punishment values and trials involving no monetary reward or punishment 42 , 43 . This inaccurate representation of reward value within frontal regions is similarly observed during the outcome phase of incentive decision trials 42 , 43 , suggesting a further failure to update accruing reward history and probability. Inaccurate coding of reward and/or punishment valence in the PFC following sleep loss may therefore prevent the ability to update changing incentive value (weights) of reinforcing stimuli over time 42 , 43 ( FIG. 2 ). This would further contribute to non-optimal reward-dependent decision making and actions. Fitting this profile, sleep-deprived individuals performing the Iowa Gambling Task make more-risky decisions and assign greater weights to more-recent rewards 45 , 46 . This pattern indicates a failure to appropriately integrate rewards and their accumulating value over time following SD, reflecting temporally shorter -sighted updating of rewards.\nIn addition to deficits in the activation of frontal reward circuits following SD, studies have revealed that responses of the striatum and amygdala to emotionally pleasurable or hedonic images 47 , as well as desirable food stimuli 48 , are amplified with SD. Moreover, the same studies reported failures of discriminatory signalling of stimulus valence (for example, discriminating desirable from undesirable foods) in the anterior insula, mPFC and OFC, of sleep-deprived participants. Furthermore, sleep- deprived individuals were more likely to rate neutral pictures as positive 47 or to express a greater desire for high-calorie foods 48 . That is, participants fail to accurately disambiguate non-rewarding from rewarding stimuli when sleep deprived, shifting towards an over-generalized reward bias, even for normally less-rewarding stimuli.\nAlthough current results of reward processing point to effects in the mPFC, OFC and insular cortex, together with the basal ganglia, other affective regions, such as the limbic regions of the medial temporal lobe and executive lateral regions of the PFC, should not be discounted. Equally important, not all human SD studies have reported amplified basal ganglia activity during reward-related decision making 49 , an inconsistency we return to below.\nBeyond monetary reward processing, another behavioural feature sensitive to a lack of sleep is impulsivity. Impulsivity is a multifactorial construct, and different types of impulsivity can manifest in behaviourally different ways. Nevertheless, impulse control is central to many incentive-based decision processes 50 , 51 . Changes in impulsivity may therefore contribute to alterations in reward decision making and risk taking that occur following SD.\nIn tasks that require either cued motor response execution or withholding, often referred to as a Go/No-Go task, participants with either partial sleep restriction (6 hours of sleep per night for 4 consecutive nights) or one night of total sleep deprivation showed considerably lower response inhibition and cognitive control, produced more frequent errors of inhibition, and exhibited slower learning of cue\u2013incentive associations 52 \u2013 56 ( FIG. 2 ).\nHowever, in delay-discounting tasks, which require participants to choose between small, immediate rewards relative to large, delayed rewards, SD does not seem to alter impulsivity \u2014 a lack of an effect that is similarly observed in probabilistic discounting tasks, in which participants choose between small but certain rewards and large but uncertain rewards 49 , 53 , 54 , 57 . Similarly, total acute SD and partial sleep restriction (4 nights of 6 hours of sleep per night) do not affect delay discounting or probabilistic discounting 54 . However, measures of effort discounting (whereby rewards are discounted according to the effort required to attain them) are affected by SD. Under conditions of sleep loss, low-effort rewards elicit even greater reward-related brain activity than high-effort rewards, relative to sleep-rested conditions 49 .\nSimilarly, inconsistent effects of SD have been reported using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) \u2014 a standard test of reward-seeking, risk-taking behaviour that involves impulse control. Partial sleep restriction (1 night of 5 hours of sleep) results in a significant increase in the tendency to overinflate a computerized balloon to obtain more reward 54 , 58 . By contrast, total SD for a single night resulted in no change in BART performance by male participants but a decrease in risky overinflation by female participants 53 (for a review, see REF. 59 ). Studies that focus on this and other specific features of impulsivity, such as response withholding, while systematically keeping other factors constant (for example, reward magnitude, reward delay and sex) are necessary to develop a clearer understanding of sleep loss and risk-taking impulsivity.\nInconsistencies in the effects of SD on incentive processing are not limited to the domain of impulsivity. Some reports using incentive tasks that do not involve impulsivity (wherein participants simply expect or receive rewards and/or punishments without needing to resist impulsive responses) have also failed to show significant differences in mesolimbic brain activity and/ or behaviour caused by SD 44 , 49 , 57 . Instead, these studies only demonstrate effects on an individual-participant level 44 , 49 , 57 . One possible explanation is that some studies employ mixed gambles, combining gains and losses in the same trial. This may limit the ability to identify differences in processing of gains or losses independently 60 . A second possibility is that individual differences may interact with the effects of SD, thus obscuring group-level significance if not explicitly considered. A recent study 60 found that individuals expressing a variant of the dopamine transporter that was previously associated with differences in synaptic dopamine availability showed different striatal reward responses following sleep loss. Unlike the control group, only participants with trait-elevated synaptic dopamine exhibited greater striatal responses during reward anticipation following SD than when well rested. This suggests that phasic dopamine availability is increased in these individuals, thereby elevating SD-associated increases in the reward responsivity of the nucleus accumbens. Thus, effects of sleep loss on reward processing seem to be sensitive to several interacting factors, including sex and trait genetics.\nWith these nuances taken into account, studies to date nevertheless indicate that SD significantly increases the tendency of reward sensitivity, risk taking and impulsivity, and disrupts reward-value updating and integration. One possible mechanism that might explain these increases in approach and consummatory behaviour is altered dopamine signalling, which is associated with extended wakefulness perhaps more than with the absence of sleep itself. Several lines of evidence support this dopaminergic framework ( FIG. 2 ).\nFirst, dopamine is associated with arousal; innately higher levels of dopamine predict lower sleep propensity 61 . Second, rodent studies have established that wake-promoting stimulant drugs such as amphetamine seem to operate in part by blocking dopamine metabolism, thereby increasing dopamine transmission and thus arousal. Third, depleting catecholamines, including dopamine, reduces wake propensity, lowering vigilance and inducing sleep 62 (although interestingly the antihypertensive and antipsychotic reserpine, which reduces catecholamine function, has nominal effects on sleepiness 63 ).\nChanges in dopamine receptors may also contribute to alterations in reward-driven behaviour following SD. Positron emission tomography (PET) ligand studies have reported that one night of total SD downregulates the availability of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2/3Rs) in both the dorsal striatum (which includes the caudate and putamen) and ventral striatum 40 ( FIG. 2 ), consistent with earlier PET studies showing general hypometabolism in the basal ganglia following SD 64 . PET-assessed downregulation of D2/3Rs in the ventral striatum predicted fMRI-measured decreases in thalamic activity during an attentional task 65 , as did the degree of generalized hypometabolism in the basal ganglia after SD 64 , 66 . Besides the relevance of this change for objective attention and working -memory performance, the degree of D2/3R downregulation similarly predicts subjective sleepiness under SD conditions 40 . This result suggests that sleep pressure might be indexed by the levels of different dopamine receptors; consistent with this, adenosine accumulates with increasing time awake, activating A 2A receptors and thereby driving D2R internalization 40 , 67 . Moreover, agonists of the A 2A receptor and D2R demonstrate allosteric interaction such that A 2A receptor agonists decrease the affinity of D2Rs for their agonists, including dopamine 68 . Thus, adenosine accumulation, which is associated with increased time spent awake, may decrease D2/3R activity by at least two possible mechanisms: by increasing D2/3R internalization and by reducing binding of dopamine to D2Rs ( FIG. 2 ).\nThat SD is associated with a downregulation of D2/3Rs may initially seem to contradict the SD-associated increases in neural and behavioural reward sensitivity described above. However, one tenable (and experimentally testable) hypothesis that may reconcile this paradox involves D1Rs. Specifically, decreases in D2/3Rs could result in an imbalance of dopamine receptor availability, leading to the remaining D1Rs becoming disproportionately stimulated by the same amount of presynaptically released dopamine ( FIG. 2 ). Outside the context of SD, in rodents, this imbalance causes greater approach behaviour to food rewards 69 and increases the addictive potential of cocaine 70 (behavioural consequences that, notably, have both been independently associated with SD 71 , 72 ). Furthermore, the increase in striatal fMRI signal elicited by reward incentives under SD conditions seems to principally reflect D1R action 73 . Thus, SD-associated decreases in D2/3R availability may, by indirectly increasing dopamine binding to the remaining D1Rs, increase approach-driven and reward-driven behaviour and fMRI-indexed striatal activity ( FIG. 2 ). The neural and behavioural consequences of sleep loss on incentive processes also offer mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the conditions of obesity, addiction and substance use ( BOX 3 ).\nPositive emotion\nThe interaction between sleep deprivation (SD) and dopaminergic reward functioning is relevant for clinical conditions involving sleep disruption and dysfunction of reward or dopamine signalling. In alcohol addiction, ~60% of alcohol-addicted individuals seeking treatment complain of insomnia symptoms in the 6 months leading up to intervention, and more than half of these individuals report using alcohol under the (erroneous) assumption that it helps to regulate sleep 157 . In addition, alcohol-addicted individuals who report insomnia are more likely to relapse than those without sleep problems 157 . Thus, sleep loss seems to be an important factor in the development and/or maintenance of addiction disorders associated with changes in mesolimbic dopamine function and a vulnerability factor predisposing individuals to fail in efforts of abstinence. Of concern, sleep disruption in childhood predicts subsequent substance use in later adolescence stages 158 .\nThere is now also considerable epidemiological evidence linking sleep disruption and obesity 159 . Experimental work has characterized the associated causal mechanisms, including changes in the appetite-regulating hormones leptin and ghrelin, and in the central brain mechanisms that regulate appetite and food choice selection 160 . Decreased activity in decision-regulating regions of the frontal cortex following SD, combined with enhanced subcortical mesolimbic sensitivity, leads to increased desire for, and selection of, high-calorie food items 48 . Indeed, compared with a sleep-rested state, experimental sleep restriction increases calorie consumption and promotes weight gain 161 .\nNotably, the alterations in brain function that have been associated with obesity overlap with those observed in drug addiction 162 ; for example, a reduction of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors is observed in both. Such findings warrant a deeper consideration of insufficient sleep as a possible predisposing factor underlying obesity and drug addiction. If true, targeted sleep restoration may aid by re-engaging neural mechanisms that govern adaptive food choices and craving, respectively.\nNegative emotion\nA recent model has proposed that sleep loss prevents the normal overnight lowering and thus restoration of central adrenergic signalling that normally occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, leading to heightened noradrenergic tone and thereby an over-generalized responsivity within select affective salience networks 84 . The translational ramifications of this model are well exemplified in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with sleep disruption and fragmentation, decreases in total and REM sleep duration 163 \u2013 165 , and nocturnal hyperarousal 166 \u2013 168 . In parallel, people with PTSD show marked alterations in noradrenergic activity 163 , including the lack of normal overnight reduction in noradrenaline levels 169 . The REM-sleep model may help to understand these co-occurring features. Specifically, decreases in night-time, total and REM sleep quantity, and increases in high-frequency electroencephalogram (EEG)-assessed activity (associated with hyperarousal) during REM sleep, are proposed to contribute to daytime hyperadrenergic tone in PTSD. Moreover, persistent hyperadrenergic activity during wakefulness could reduce subsequent night-time sleep quantity and quality, producing a vicious cycle. Crucially, this cycle could lead to over-generalized emotional sensitivity within the affective salience network of the brain that is innervated by noradrenaline, including the amygdala, and the viscerosensory regions of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex, as already reported in a meta-analysis of functional MRI studies in PTSD 89 . This same model could explain how nocturnal use of prazosin \u2014 an \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist commonly prescribed for PTSD \u2014 can, in some cohorts, restore the duration and quality of total and REM sleep, and decrease PTSD symptoms 170 \u2013 173 . Our framework may also account for the excessive emotion reactivity and impaired emotional discrimination observed in PTSD 174 \u2013 176 , and the maladaptive generalization of fear responses to commonly non-threatening stimuli 174 \u2013 176 . Interestingly, PTSD-like symptomatology was experimentally induced by selective deprivation of REM sleep in healthy individuals; this manipulation resulted in increased autonomic sensitivity to previously extinguished conditioned stimuli (that is, heightened sensitivity) and impaired autonomic discrimination of conditioned from safety signals (decreased emotional specificity) 177 \u2013 179 . Conversely, the amount and EEG quality of REM sleep predicts participants\u2019 ability to accurately discriminate between threat and safety signals (indicating improved emotional specificity) 180 .\nSleep loss reliably triggers changes in negative (aversive) emotional processing, including irritability, emotional volatility, anxiety and aggression 56 , 74 \u2013 77 , as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide completion 78 \u2013 80 . These findings suggest that SD alters specific process domains, including basic affective reactivity, as well as emotional discrimination and emotional expression, which are more complex.\nEarly neuroimaging studies focused on the effects of SD on responsivity to rudimentary aversive stimuli; for example, one night of SD was shown to result in a 60% increase in amygdala reactivity to negative images, such as weapons, venomous snakes and spiders, and mutilations 81 ( FIG. 3 ). This signature of amygdala hyper-reactivity has since been replicated following sleep restriction (4 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights) 82 and in individuals with poor sleep quality, as assessed at their homes 83 . Notably, amygdala hyper-reactivity has been reported during rapid, subconscious viewing of faces expressing fear after sleep restriction 82 , indicating that this amplified limbic reactivity can occur subliminally, independent of conscious, deliberative cognition 82 .\nOne possible mechanism underlying such amygdala hypersensitivity involves a loss of regulatory control, resulting in contextually inappropriate amygdala reactivity 84 . Decreases in functional connectivity between top-down control regions of the mPFC and the amygdala have been reported following a night of total SD or 5 nights of partial sleep restriction (4 hours sleep per night), as well as in participants reporting less than 6 hours of habitual sleep 81 \u2013 83 , 85 , 86 ( FIG. 3 ).\nSD further alters the brain anticipation of cued emotional experiences. For example, one night of SD elevates cue-evoked activity in the amygdala, anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex in anticipation of impending emotional picture slides, similar to those described above 87 , and also increases anticipatory responses of the peripheral autonomic nervous system 88 .\nInterestingly, inter-individual differences in trait anxiety levels predict the size of these SD-induced increases in anticipatory brain activity, with highly trait-anxious individuals expressing the largest increases in pre-emptive anterior insula activity 87 . The latter result is of clinical relevance to anxiety disorders (which have been associated with apprehensive worry about future events) for at least three reasons: first, highly trait-anxious individuals are already those at greatest risk for developing an anxiety disorder; second, excessive anticipatory insula activity is a characteristic of most anxiety disorders 89 \u2013 91 ; and third, sleep disruption is a recognized symptom of anxiety disorders 92 .\nAn additional phenotype of the sleep-deprived human brain emerges when participants are challenged with the more complex task of disambiguating between varied emotional signals. In sleep-rested participants, regions of the amygdala, insula and cingulate that are associated with salience detection can discriminate between stimuli of different emotional strengths. By contrast, in sleep-deprived participants, these regions demonstrate a saturated and flattened response to emotional stimuli. Sleep-deprived individuals therefore express a generalized excess of emotional sensitivity, with impairment in emotional discriminatory specificity 84 ( FIG. 3 ). For example, sleep-deprived individuals are less accurate at rating facial expressions within the moderate range of emotional strength 93 and rate neutral images as more emotionally negative 94 . SD further impairs the accurate discrimination of threatening (antisocial) from affiliative (pro-social) facial signals 95 , again promoting an overall bias towards increased (inaccurate) perception of negative threat.\nRecent work has begun to uncover the neural basis of these impairments in emotional discrimination ( FIG. 3 ). Consistent with the failure to accurately code positive, reward incentive signals (described above), one night of SD impairs the discrimination of faces expressing negative emotions by viscerosensory regions of the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortices, and to a degree, the subcortical amygdala 95 . Similarly, sleep loss results in generalized, nonspecific increases in amygdala activity (as measured by fMRI or electroencephalography) in response to aversive and neutral emotional pictures 96 , 97 .\nThese findings have led to the proposal that SD causes a state of central and peripheral emotional hypersensitivity that prevents emotional reactivity from being appropriately graded 84 . As a result, SD impairs the afferent\u2013efferent communication between the brain and body, which is crucial for the \u2018embodied\u2019 mapping of, and disambiguation between, different emotions. The consequence is a behavioural phenotype of indiscriminate emotional generalization, or blunting, consistent with poor signal-to-noise balance during emotional processing 84 ( FIG. 3 ).\nSuch blunting may disrupt not only the internal mapping of an individual\u2019s own affective state but also the ability to simulate the feelings of others. Supporting this hypothesis, sleep-deprived individuals and habitually poor sleepers demonstrate impaired empathetic sensitivity, which involved sensing the emotion state of individuals in picture slides 98 , 99 . Sensing the internal homeostatic status of the body, and thereby tracking one\u2019s own affective state, requires interoceptive processing within a network that includes the insula, mPFC and amygdala 100 . Sleep loss degrades the sensitivity of this network, leading to a shift of the homeostatic set point used to register, and differentiate between different levels of, emotional salience 95 . In an emotional face discrimination task, sleep-deprived individuals showed overgeneralized activity in viscerosensory brain regions and impaired autonomic cardiac discrimination (indexed using moment-by-moment changes in heart rate) 95 . Compared with when they were rested, individuals who were sleep deprived also showed a weaker correlation between the activity of the central and peripheral autonomic (cardiac) systems. Thus, SD compromises the faithful discrimination of emotional signals within higher-order emotional brain regions by inducing network hypersensitivity and, in tandem, disrupts the \u2018embodied\u2019 reciprocity between viscerosensory central and peripheral autonomic processing of complex social signals. As a result, there can be a loss of sensitivity in detecting, and accuracy in recognizing, emotions.\nIt is possible, although currently untested, that this same disruption within and between central and peripheral autonomic nervous system networks explains why sleep-deprived adults 101 and infants deprived of a day-time nap 102 show incongruent or even absent outward expression of emotions ( FIG. 3 ). Individuals restricted to 4 hours of sleep for a single night also demonstrate a slowing of reactive facial expressions in response to emotional stimuli 103 . Emotional vocalizations following short-term sleep restriction have similarly been reported to be blunted 104 .\nThus, multiple modes of emotional expression are diminished by insufficient sleep; a feature pertinent considering that emotional expressions are all influenced in some manner by the autonomic nervous system, specifically the vagal system 105 . This same explanatory model of central\u2013peripheral autonomic decoupling may offer further mechanistic insights into the recognized associations between reduced sleep and decreased interpersonal functioning 108 , increased antisocial interactions 109 , a lower understanding of relationship concerns (leading to greater interpersonal conflict) 110 and, in children and adolescents, increased peer-related problems, such as hyperactivity and inattention, conduct problems, and peer disagreement 106 , 107 .\nLess understood are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the emotional brain and body dysfunction that is caused by a lack of sleep. One proposed mechanism has centred on the heightened noradrenergic tone from the locus coeruleus 84 , 111 , 112 ; according to this hypothesis, sleep loss prevents the normal overnight reduction in noradrenergic tone that usually occurs during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep 112 \u2013 114 . The resulting hypernoradrenergic tone may thus lead to heightened and over-generalized responsivity within the affective salience network that is innervated by noradrenaline: the amygdala and the viscerosensory cortical regions 84 . Consequently, there may be a loss of specificity in affective signalling within this network, possibly helping to explain the SD-associated inaccuracy in emotional discrimination. This REM sleep model 84 offers several testable predictions regarding the reliable co-occurrence of sleep disruption (including REM sleep disruption) in clinical anxiety disorders ( BOX 3 ). However, noradrenaline alone is unlikely to be the sole neurochemical factor underlying the affective dysregulation caused by SD. Integrating changes in other sleep-dependent neurochemicals, such as dopamine, may provide a more accurate explanatory model.\nMany studies have characterized the beneficial impact of sleep on the post-learning, offline consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories (for a review, see REF. 115 ). By contrast, few studies have explored the adverse effects of SD on this process 115 ; instead, the majority of such neuroimaging investigations have examined the impact of sleep loss on initial hippocampus-dependent memory encoding, on which we focus here.\nIn rodents, SD substantially decreases the ability to induce hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP; an electrophysiological measure of neuroplasticity) and, if LTP is induced, the enhancement subsequently decays more rapidly 116 . Further, sleep loss reduces hippocampal synthesis of proteins associated with neuroplasticity and impairs hippocampal neurogenesis 117 .\nThe extracellular build-up of the metabolic product adenosine during extended wake affects plasticity. High levels of adenosine disrupt intracellular cAMP signalling in rodents and decreases hippocampal AMPA and NMDA receptor signalling; all of which are necessary for stable LTP 115 . Given that adenosine is cleared from the brain during sleep, these effects on plasticity may result from two mutually non-exclusive reasons: abnormally extended wake or a loss of sleep.\nBuilding on these findings, early human neuroimaging and behavioural studies established that one night of SD impairs learning and encoding-related activity within the medial temporal lobe 118 , specifically the hippocampus 36 ( FIG. 4 ). Moreover, selective deprivation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow-wave sleep using auditory stimulation, which preserves total sleep time, also lowers encoding-related activity in the hippocampus and associated learning 119 . Conversely, enhancing the power of NREM slow-wave activity, using transcranial stimulation, increases hippocampal learning ability after sleep 120 , further supporting a causal role for slow-wave sleep in hippocampal memory encoding.\nSleep deprivation (SD) decreases encoding-related activity within the hippocampus (light blue), compared with normal sleep-rested conditions. Moreover, in sleep-deprived individuals, hippocampal connectivity with encoding-relevant cortical regions of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and primary visual cortex (V1) (purple regions) during encoding is lower than in sleep-rested individuals. By contrast, hippocampal encoding-related connectivity with subcortical arousal regions of the thalamus and brainstem (red) after SD is increased.\nIn addition, SD alters learning-related hippocampal connectivity. Functional coupling between the hippocampus and perceptual regions of the occipital (visual) cortex and nearby regions in the medial temporal lobe during visual episodic-memory encoding is decreased under SD conditions 36 ( FIG. 4 ). By contrast, SD is also associated with increases in hippocampal connectivity with subcortical arousal regions, including the brainstem and the thalamus 36 ( FIG. 4 ). The latter observation has been interpreted as reflecting a compensatory effort to mobilize basic arousal networks, albeit insufficient to rescue behavioural performance 36 .\nA recent report has demonstrated that the structural morphology of the human hippocampus, and specifically the volume of the CA3\u2013dentate gyrus subfield region, predicts the degree of vulnerability to the impact of SD on memory encoding 121 . Moreover, this same measure also predicted the amplitude of NREM slow-wave oscillations during recovery sleep and, by way of this mediating influence, determined how well memory-encoding ability was restored when assessed again after recovery sleep. Thus, human hippocampal subfield anatomy may represent a novel trait-like factor and potential biomarker of susceptibility of memory processing to, and recovery from, the disrupting effects of SD.\nThe hippocampus does not operate in isolation during memory encoding, however, but acts in a broad network of anatomically and functionally connected cortical regions. Some of these are proposed to participate in encoding memory representations themselves (for example, sensory perceptual regions), whereas others are involved in operations that support the act of encoding, such as the DLPFC and posterior parietal regions, which are required for directed attention 32 . Consistent with this, human neuroimaging studies have revealed that SD is associated with larger-network impairments that co-occur or are functionally linked with deficits in hippocampus-dependent encoding of new memories. For example, SD for 24 hours decreases activity in regions of the DLPFC and posterior parietal cortex required for goal-directed attention during a visual episodic- memory encoding task 122 . Reductions in the activity of the scene-selective fusiform cortex following SD are less clear to interpret and may reflect impairment in the functional role of the visual cortex in processing visual scenes and/or the failure of the top-down control of attention by frontoparietal networks 123 . Nevertheless, the size of the alterations in activity of all three of these cortical regions (frontal, parietal and occipital) predict the degree of memory impairment under SD conditions and the severity of attentional task lapses.\nAs with working-memory and selective attention tasks, significant differences in DMN activity within cortical regions have been reported during episodic-memory encoding following SD 124 . Indeed, the size of reductions and increases in the activity of the anterior cingulate and precuneus (which are both nodes of the DMN), respectively, discriminated sleep-deprived from sleep-rested participants with 93% sensitivity and 92% specificity 124 . Unstable control of the DMN might therefore be a common neural phenotype underlying deficits in various cognitive tasks (including attention, working memory and episodic memory) in the sleep-deprived human brain ( BOX 2 ).\nOnly one study to date has examined the under lying neurochemical basis of memory-encoding deficits associated with SD. Administration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which prolongs the central synaptic effects of acetylcholine, partially restored activity in frontoparietal and fusiform regions in sleep-deprived participants towards levels observed under sleep-rested conditions 122 ( FIG. 4 ). Interestingly, the greatest benefit of this acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment was observed in those individuals who, with SD, demonstrated the largest decreases in brain activity during a semantic judgement task and the worst performance in word recognition. That is, those most susceptible to sleep loss on these tasks were those who recovered most function after being treated with the drug.\nGiven that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors enhance attentional processes that support episodic memory 125 and directly affect sensory processing 126 , some part of this benefit might be mediated by cholinergic influences on arousal. An alternative or additional plausible hypothesis is that the actions of the inhibitor facilitate hippocampal plasticity mechanisms that consequentially increase hippocampal engagement of sensory and attentional networks in the cortex. Accordingly, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors enhance activation of the visual and parietal cortices in sleep-deprived individuals during a visual short-term-memory task and, compared with placebo, improve task performance 127 .\nAt a translational level, impaired hippocampus-dependent memory encoding following sleep loss is relevant to several disorders and conditions that involve deficiencies in both sleep and memory encoding. Two such examples are ageing and dementia. Older, cognitively normal adults show marked impairments in NREM sleep, and these deficits are magnified in size in Alzheimer disease 128 . Disruptions of NREM sleep and associated reductions in slow-wave activity and sleep spindles in older adults and, even more dramatically, in patients with Alzheimer disease predict reductions in encoding-related activity in the hippocampus on the following day, which, in turn, predict the degree of learning impairment 119 , 129 . Sleep disruption therefore may contribute to cognitive decline, and especially impairments in hippocampus-dependent memory processing, with ageing. This evidence raises the possibility that sleep restoration may be a novel therapeutic intervention, as well as a midlife preventative measure against age-related decline in hippocampus-dependent memory (for a more detailed discussion, see REF. 128 ).\nSeveral insights emerge from this Review. First, SD triggers a complex set of bidirectional changes in brain activity and connectivity \u2014 depending on the specific functional operation and anatomical regions in question. Equally important, however, are moment-to-moment fluctuations in brain activity that occur during performance across the timescale of minutes, reflecting a neural phenotype of regional and network instability. This is especially apparent in the domains of attention and working memory. Second, the heterogeneous array of brain changes (averaged and moment-to-moment) results in an equally diverse set of disruptions in human behaviour across nearly all domains of cognition and affect. Nested within this statement is another related subtlety: not all changes in brain function that are associated with sleep loss are maladaptive and thus represent deficiencies. Instead, some aspects of these neural alterations seem to correlate with preserved task performance, indicating that they may be compensatory and thus adaptive. That the human brain can compensate for SD to a certain degree seems tenable, given that individuals use compensatory effort and behavioural strategies (for example, talking or standing) when attempting to stay awake when sleep deprived. However, the extent and duration of compensatory brain function, which networks and associated operations they are in, and which behaviours are maintained as a consequence, remain poorly characterized. For example, do the effects of SD depend on interactions among hierarchies of functional brain networks, such that deficits or compensation in a fundamental, base-level network (for example, the attention network) dictates respective impairment (or compensation) in higher-level, dependent operations (such as intentional memory encoding or conscious emotional processing)?\nEqually important, this Review reveals our current inadequacies of knowledge regarding the sleep- deprived human brain. For example, we have remarkably little understanding of the whole-brain consequences of long-term, chronic sleep loss, as most studies have focused on acute, total SD ( BOX 1 ). Such knowledge would be crucial considering that chronic partial sleep restriction, from weeks to years, is representative of (and thus relevant to) the sleep deficiency observed in the developed world. We also lack any comprehensive understanding of whether and how human brain networks may recover from acute and chronic sleep restriction. Are the underlying neural mechanisms that support recovery from these different forms of sleep loss the same, partially overlapping, or entirely separable? Relatedly, does neural recovery occur across the same time period or over a different temporal duration following different forms and doses of sleep loss? What types of recovery sleep stages and/or aspects of sleep physiology transact functional brain restoration following sleep loss? These questions are important from a societal and public-health perspective, both in professional circumstances in which the privation of sleep is rife (for example, in the military, in aviation and in medicine) and in subtler forms (for example, the public trend of short sleep durations during the week followed by longer sleep durations at weekends).\nAnother key unresolved issue extends beyond the phenotypic between-participant differences in vulnerability to the neural and behavioural effects of SD within a cognitive domain (such as attention) ( BOX 1 ) and centres on emerging evidence suggesting within-participant, between-domain differences in vulnerability: an individual who is resilient to the effects of SD in one functional domain (such as attention) may conversely be vulnerable to that same dose of sleep loss in other functional domains (such as memory or emotion processing) 130 . This suggests that different brain networks in the same individual may be differentially susceptible to sleep loss. These hypothetical within-subject differences in neural network vulnerability and resilience to SD have not yet been experimentally tested.\nFinally, the basic scientific findings regarding sleep loss have not yet been routinely applied in the clinic, despite the examples that we describe in BOX 3 . Sleep abnormalities are robustly observed in every major disorder of the brain, both neurological and psychiatric. Sleep disruption merits recognition as a key relevant factor in these disorders at all levels, from diagnosis and underlying aetiology, to therapy and prevention. More collaborative work between basic and clinical scientists in the field will be necessary to accomplish this goal. Notably, the answers to all these questions have perhaps never been more pressing considering the professional, societal and clinical implications that continue to scale in lockstep with the precipitous decline in sleep duration throughout industrialized nations.\nThis work was supported by awards R01-AG031164, R01-AG054019, RF1-AG054019 and R01-MH093537 to M.P.W. from the US National Institutes of Health.\n1.

The official general election results indicate that Trump received 304 Electoral College votes and 46.09% of the popular vote (62,984,825 votes), and Hillary Clinton received 227 Electoral College votes and 48.18% of the popular vote (65,853,516 votes).\nPrior to the 2016 election, there were four times in US history when a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote : 1824 (John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes over Samuel Tilden), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison over Grover Cleveland), and 2000 (George W. Bush over Al Gore).\nThe Electoral College was established in 1788 by Article II of the US Constitution, which also established the executive branch of the US government, and was revised by the Twelfth Amendment (ratified June 15, 1804), the Fourteenth Amendment (ratified July 1868), and the Twenty-Third Amendment (ratified Mar. 29, 1961). Because the procedure for electing the president is part of the Constitution, a Constitutional Amendment (which requires two-thirds approval in both houses of Congress plus approval by 38 states) would be required to abolish the Electoral College.\nThe Founding Fathers created the Electoral College as a compromise between electing the president via a vote in Congress only or via a popular vote only. The Electoral College comprises 538 electors; each state is allowed one elector for each Representative and Senator (DC is allowed 3 electors as established by the Twenty-Third Amendment).\nIn each state, a group of electors is chosen by each political party. On election day, voters choosing a presidential candidate are actually casting a vote for an elector. Most states use the \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d method, in which all electoral votes are awarded to the winner of the popular vote in that state. In Nebraska and Maine, the candidate that wins the state\u2019s overall popular vote receives two electors, and one elector from each congressional district is apportioned to the popular vote winner in that district. For a candidate to win the presidency, he or she must win at least 270 Electoral College votes.\nAt least 700 amendments have been proposed to modify or abolish the Electoral College.\nOn Monday Dec. 19, 2016, the electors in each state met to vote for President and Vice President of the United States. Of the 538 Electoral College votes available, Donald J. Trump received 304 votes, Hillary Clinton received 227 votes, and seven votes went to others: three for Colin Powell, one for Faith Spotted Eagle, one for John Kasich, one for Ron Paul, and one for Bernie Sanders). On Dec. 22, 2016, the results were certified in all 50 states. On Jan. 6, 2017, a joint session of the US Congress met to certify the election results and Vice President Joe Biden, presiding as President of the Senate, read the certified vote tally.\nA Sep. 2020 Gallup poll found 61% of Americans were in favor of abolishing the Electoral College, up 12 points from 2016.\nFor the 2020 election, electors voted on Dec. 14, and delivered the results on Dec. 23. [23] On Jan. 6, 2021, Congress held a joint session to certify the electoral college votes during which several Republican lawmakers objected to the results and pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol sending Vice President Pence, lawmakers and staff to secure locations.

Fingers are a glaring exception\u2014we\u2019ve got a party of five on each side. This presents difficulties. When we want to single one out from the group\u2014to specify which finger we slammed in the door, for instance\u2014what do we do? We name them, naturally. But how?\nThis is a uniquely human problem. Pentadactyly \u2014the condition of having five fingers\u2014is pervasive in the biological world, but we are the only species that has the capacity (or occasion) to talk about those fingers. The problem is not just that we have five of them, but that they are so vexingly similar: they differ slightly in size and dexterity, but all have that pucker-knuckled, nail-capped look. How have people in different times and places solved this problem? How have they named the members of this confusable quintet? Answering this question offers a tour of the inventiveness of the human mind.\nConsider first the thumb . Appearance is an especially common source of thumb names. The modern English word, for example, comes from an older word meaning \u201cstout\u201d or \u201cthick.\u201d Other languages highlight the fact that the thumb is powerful, despite its short stature. The Latin term for this member\u2014 pollex , still used in medical contexts \u2014comes from a verb meaning \u201cto be strong.\u201d In Kurdish, these associations of compactness and strength come together in the label \u201cram finger.\u201d\nGet your fix of JSTOR Daily\u2019s best stories in your inbox each Thursday.\nPrivacy Policy Contact Us\nYou may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\nThe case of \u201cram finger\u201d hints at a broader pattern: we often see our fingers as animate beings, little agents with their own personalities. We thus often name them after animals or after human social roles. In some Native American languages , the thumb is called the \u201cchief finger.\u201d Elsewhere it is cast as a family member : the terms \u201cmother,\u201d \u201cfather,\u201d \u201colder brother,\u201d or \u201cgrandfather finger\u201d are all attested. Although scarce in Europe, labels that compare fingers to humans are common worldwide. One study found such names in a fifth of the 123 languages surveyed.\nThe thumb has attracted an array of other names. In Greek, it is known as \u201cwhat is opposite the fingers.\u201d In several Turkic languages , it is known as the \u201chead finger.\u201d In some parts of the Middle East and Mediterranean, the name for the thumb stems from an unsavory function that, thankfully, it no longer has to serve (much): the lice killer.\nUp next: the index finger . This label comes from the finger\u2019s use in pointing: the English word index is rooted in an earlier word meaning \u201cto show.\u201d Names that associate this finger with pointing can be found around the globe, but others come into play as well. English speakers also call it the forefinger because of its position as the first of the fingers proper, excluding the thumb. Medieval texts refer to it as the \u201cgreeter\u201d and \u201cteacher.\u201d In Anglo-Saxon times, it was known as the \u201cscythe finger,\u201d for reasons that are murky, and as the \u201cshooting finger,\u201d because it was used to draw back a bowstring.\nAround the world, the index finger is associated with other functions. In Iranian languages, it is considered the finger of beckoning, cursing, and protecting. It is also known as the \u201cprayer finger\u201d or \u201ctestimony finger\u201d\u2014the label in modern Turkish\u2014because of its use in the Muslim practice of shahada , or profession of faith. One of its most colorful nicknames was based on its penchant for swiping up sauces: the \u201cpot licker.\u201d\nNext up: the middle finger . English is not the only language to name this finger for its central position\u2014the \u201chalf-way finger\u201d is another example. Some embellish the idea: in Choctaw, it is known as the \u201cmiddle son,\u201d and in some Turkic languages, it is dubbed the \u201cmiddle poplar,\u201d evoking the image of the fingers as a stand of trees. Another salient aspect of this middlemost finger is, of course, its length. So we find monikers like the \u201clong finger\u201d or \u201ctall finger,\u201d and colorful variants like the \u201chigh grass\u201d or \u201ctall Turk.\u201d\nIn Latin, the middle finger was known as the digitus impudicus or obscenus \u2014that is, the shameless or lewd finger. Some suggest these terms were due to its use in one of our crudest gestures , but a deeper reason may lie in its appearance. The middle finger, when extended and flanked on either side, is said to resemble a penis and testicles. This phallic form is, in fact, what motivated the gesture in the first place. Another explanation for the lewdness, as one observer notes, is that this is the digit often used to stimulate the female genitals.\nFourth in line: the ring finger . Everyone will recognize the origins of this nickname in modern ring-wearing practices. But not all are aware of the deeper history behind this tradition. According to medieval belief, a nerve or artery ran from the ring finger to the heart. This notion led people to don rings on this digit. It also gave the finger a prominent role in medical lore and practice. Doctors would use the ring finger when applying treatments, for example. Such associations inspired the terms \u201cdoctor finger,\u201d \u201chealing finger,\u201d \u201cheart finger,\u201d and \u201cleech finger\u201d\u2014the last because leech was another word for physician.\nThe term \u201cring finger\u201d is now found around the globe. But another, somewhat paradoxical name is also popular: the \u201cnameless finger.\u201d This label was once used in parts of Europe, leading Wilhelm Grimm, of fairy tale fame, to speculate about its origins. One of his ideas was that the name alludes to this digit\u2019s squeaky-clean reputation, in contrast to that of its lewd neighbor. Another was that, because of the finger\u2019s quasi-mystical uses in healing, some dared not speak its name.\nA simpler explanation may be in order, however. This same paradoxical label is found in Native American languages and in Chinese, making it unlikely that it stems from cultural beliefs peculiar to Europe. Rather, the nameless-ness of this finger may be due to its utter unremarkability. Sandwiched between more distinctive fingers, and not particularly useful, the ring finger is\u2014let\u2019s face it\u2014the forgettable also-ran of the bunch.\nLittlest but not least: the pinky . Appearances aside, the English word has nothing to do with the color pink\u2014rather, it was borrowed from Dutch. The deeper origins of the word are debated, but it may have stuck around because it bears a suffix (\u201c-y\u201d) often used in English for small, endearing things. The pinky is, after all, the loveable runt of the hand.\nA fixation on the size of this digit is found the world over. It is variously called the \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cyoungest child,\u201d or \u201clast-born daughter.\u201d In Turkish, it is known as the \u201csparrow finger,\u201d after the distinctively diminutive bird. A related idea is that this finger is a bit of a straggler. In some places, it is known as the \u201corphan\u201d or \u201cbehind\u201d finger.\nFrankly, the little finger does not do a whole lot. Terms based on its functions are thus somewhat scarce. One exception is found in Latin, where the pinky was labeled the auricularis \u2014that is, the \u201cear finger.\u201d This aural association, still found in modern French, is due to what is perhaps this finger\u2019s most noteworthy talent: wax removal.\nThese solutions to the finger-naming problem showcase the human mind at work\u2014and at play. In language after language, digits are named for their appearance, position, and size. They are likened to birds, dogs, and sheep, compared to chiefs, children, parents, and grandparents. They are recognized for their roles in praying, hunting, healing, cursing, licking pots, and squashing pests. Surveying this colorful compendium, we find, on the one hand, unexpected patterns and, on the other, delightful diversity.\nIs this diversity a thing of the past? Is the finger-naming problem solved once and for all? There are some signs that digital nomenclature is, like much else, headed toward global homogeneity. But the matter is hardly settled. We keep finding new uses for our hands, which could inspire new names. Cultures are constantly changing and forging new associations. This curious corner of human communication will continue to bear the hallmarks of our species\u2019 inventiveness. Or so we can hope."], "citation_links": ["https://daily.jstor.org/where-do-finger-names-come-from/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_92cb4e85-f304-4b4a-8eb8-9b84c8cd50d5"}

In the 7th century BCE, Thebes became a major city again.", "references": ["Four of the main complexes of ruins are discussed in separate articles. ( See Karnak ; Luxor ; Valley of the Kings ; Valley of the Queens .) Among the other chief sites of Thebes are the royal mortuary temples , the palace of Amenhotep III, and the Tombs of the Nobles.\nIn the New Kingdom , when the pharaohs hid their tombs in the secret Valley of the Kings (in western Thebes), ostentation had to be concentrated in their mortuary temples , which rivaled each other in size and magnificence. Although they were designed for the performance of rites connected with the mortuary cult of the builder, they were all dedicated to Amon , the supreme god of Thebes, and had the character and essential form of a New Kingdom temple. They were built in a sequence generally corresponding to a topographic arrangement from north to south. Only traces of most of the earlier ones remain. The most important will be mentioned here.\nThe temple of Hatshepsut (reigned 1472\u201358 bce ) at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b is the earliest large 18th-dynasty structure to survive and one of the most impressive. There in the bay of cliffs, next to the pyramid-temple of Mentuhotep II , the queen\u2019s architect Senenmut designed ( c. 1473) a series of colonnades and courts on three levels. The approach from the valley led through an avenue of sphinxes , and in the forecourt was a garden planted with trees and vines. On either side of the sloping ramp leading to the next level, against the terrace face, was a gallery whose roof was supported on a double row of columns; a similar gallery ran along the westward side of the court on the next level, with side chapels dedicated to Anubis and Hathor . The top terrace contained a hall of columns, with further chapels on either side and a sanctuary dug into the cliff behind. Many of the surviving series of reliefs in the colonnades and chapels are of great beauty and considerable interest: one depicts the transport of two obelisks by barge from Asw\u0101n to Karnak, another the divine marriage of Queen Ahmes with the god Amon and the resultant miraculous birth of Hatshepsut herself, and a third the maritime trading expedition sent by the queen to Punt , the land of incense on the Red Sea .\nThe mortuary temple of Amenhotep III (reigned 1390\u201353 bce ) must have been the largest and most splendid of all the Theban temples. It was, however, almost completely demolished by later pharaohs, and all that is left today are a few foundations, a huge stela 33 feet (10 metres) high, and the two great statues known as the Colossi of Memnon , which once flanked the gateway in front of the temple pylon but now sit like lonely sentinels in the middle of a field. The statues represent Amenhotep III but the name Memnon is of (later) Greek origin; with their crowns the statues were about 70 feet (21 metres) high, each hewn from a single block of stone. The northern one, after cracking in an earthquake, was the \u201csinging Memnon\u201d celebrated in classical times because on certain days, shortly after sunrise, it emitted a curious high note; numerous Roman tourists, including the emperor Hadrian (reigned 117\u2013138 bce ) and his wife Sabina, came to Thebes to hear this marvel, but in the reign of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus (193\u2013211) the statue was patched with masonry and never \u201csang\u201d again.\nThe temple of Seti I (reigned 1290\u201379 bce ) at Al-Qurnah survives only in part, the forecourt and pylons having disappeared. It was dedicated in part to Ramses I , the father of Seti, and was completed by Seti\u2019s son Ramses II (reigned 1279\u201313), who figures in the reliefs. The walls are decorated with scenes of purely religious content in which the pharaohs make offerings to various gods or are favoured by them.\nThe Ramesseum , or mortuary temple of Ramses II the Great, though much ruined, retains some of its ancient grandeur . The wide outer pylon is decorated with vigorous scenes of the king\u2019s wars against the Hittites in Syria, and the inner pylon has episodes from the Battle of Kadesh (1275) and scenes from the festival of the harvest god, Min . Tall figures of the king in the guise of Osiris decorate the pillars of the inner court. In the first court stood a seated colossus of Ramses II; only fragments of it are left, but enough to show that it was of enormous size. It must have been more than 55 feet (17 metres) high and weighed about 1,000 tons. The hypostyle hall beyond the second court is similar in design to that of the Great Temple of Amon at Karnak; beyond were further pillared halls and a sanctuary that has now disappeared. Around the temple, within the high brick enclosure wall, are very extensive remains of vaulted buildings that must have been magazines (storehouses), stables, workshops, and houses belonging to the temple staff. The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (flourished 1st century bce ) described the Ramesseum under the name of \u201cthe Tomb of Ozymandias.\u201d\nThe temple of Ramses III (reigned 1187\u201356) at Mad\u012bnat Habu is the latest and most southerly of the great New Kingdom mortuary temples. The general plan was modeled on that of the Ramesseum: a wide front pylon, outer and inner peristyle courts separated by a second pylon, a large pillared hall and two smaller vestibules , and the sanctuary surrounded by smaller rooms. The hypostyle hall is partly ruined, the pillars having been dismantled to the level of the first or second drums, but the temple is otherwise well preserved. Scenes carved on the walls of the inner halls show the king performing acts of worship before the gods. There are also scenes of battle in which the king in his chariot mows down the Libyans, attacks an Amorite city, and leads Libyans, Asians, and sea raiders as prisoners before Amon and Mut . On the external wall of the temple, a great sea battle between Egyptians and the Peleset ( Philistines ) and other Sea Peoples is depicted with much lively detail. Another outstanding relief is that on the outer face of the great pylon, which shows the pharaoh hunting wild cattle in a reed-covered, marshy landscape. Adjoining the temple are the remains of a palace. The high gate in the eastern side of the perimeter wall of the temple area is battlemented like a fortress . Within the precinct are other, smaller temples: one dates from the reign during the 15th century bce of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III but was altered and added to in various reigns and during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. There are also several mortuary chapels, a sacred lake, a well, and remains, as in the Ramesseum, of houses and vaulted magazines built of mud brick.\nSouth of the temple of Mad\u012bnat Habu stand the ruins of what must have been one of the finest buildings in western Thebes: the palace of King Amenhotep III and Queen Tiy at Malkata. It is in fact four palaces, one of which was occupied by Tiy. There was also a vast artificial lake, still traceable by a line of mounds to the southeast of Malkata, which may have been a harbour for shipping connected with the Nile.\nThe limestone foothills that lie parallel to the river and about 3 miles (5 km) away from it are honeycombed for a distance of more than 2 miles (3 km) with the Tombs of the Nobles, mainly of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties . The usual plan of these tombs included a forecourt, a transverse chamber, a long, corridor-like room, and, at the end, a chapel containing statues of the deceased and his family, in the floor of which a shaft or passage ran down to the burial chamber. After the funeral the shaft was filled in, but the chapel and anterooms were kept open and visited by the family of the tomb owner. Near the villages of Dira \u02bfAb\u016b al-Nega\u02be al-Asasif, Al-Kh\u016b khah Shaykh \u02bfAbd al-Qurnah, Dayr al-Mad\u012bnah , and Qurnat Mura\u02bei, several hundred tomb-chapels are still open to view. The walls are decorated with mural paintings, many of them wonderfully fresh and full of vivid interest, depicting the daily occupations of the ancient Egyptians. The dead are shown, in the outer rooms of these tombs, inspecting the workmen on their estates or in their hours of leisure hunting birds in the marshes or game in the desert, listening to music, or playing checkers with their wives. In the infinite variety of these homely scenes, the whole cycle of the farmer\u2019s year, from plowing to harvest, is depicted; sculptors, metalworkers, weavers, and brickmakers ply their trades; and butchers, brewers, and cooks prepare food for the deceased\u2019s table. The treasurer goes on his rounds of inspection, and the vizier receives foreign envoys to the pharaoh\u2019s court. The merry patterns on the roofs derive from those in houses of the period. In the inner chapels fewer secular scenes are found. The funeral ritual is usually depicted: the cort\u00e8ge crossing the Nile, the ceremony of \u201cOpening the Mouth\u201d by the tomb door, the funerary feast; while in the innermost chamber there are representations of the deceased man and his wife in the company of Osiris and other gods undergoing the ordeal of judgment known as the \u201cweighing of the heart\u201d or being given nourishment by the goddess in the sacred sycamore. In the tombs of the late New Kingdom, purely religious scenes predominate.\nIn ancient Egypt there were other great cities, but none that has left so great a legacy to posterity . The great temples of Thebes with their historical scenes and inscriptions, the tombs with their wealth of illustration of daily life and religious belief, and the countless antiquities that now fill the museums and private collections of the world, are all aspects of that legacy.

People have a right to express their opinions, but others also have a right to be offended and express their disagreement. Would you like more information on this topic?", "references": ["In a variety of arenas, Americans are debating the boundaries of free expression. Dean John Ellison\u2019s recent welcome letter to incoming University of Chicago freshmen proclaimed that the school would not support \u201csafe spaces\u201d or \u201ctrigger warnings,\u201d pouring more fuel on heated debates about campus free speech. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick generated controversy by kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against racial injustice in the United States. And social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are struggling with how to handle online hate speech .\nEnshrined in the Bill of Rights, free expression is a bedrock American principle, and Americans tend to express stronger support for free expression than many others around the world. A 38-nation Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2015 found that Americans were among the most supportive of free speech, freedom of the press and the right to use the internet without government censorship.\nMoreover, Americans are much more tolerant of offensive speech than people in other nations. For instance, 77% in the U.S. support the right of others to make statements that are offensive to their own religious beliefs, the highest percentage among the nations in the study. Fully 67% think people should be allowed to make public statements that are offensive to minority groups, again the highest percentage in the poll. And the U.S. was one of only three nations where at least half endorse the right to sexually explicit speech. Americans don\u2019t necessarily like offensive speech more than others, but they are much less inclined to outlaw it.\nTo get a summary measure of support for free expression around the world, we built an index based on five survey questions about free speech and three about free media. Using this measure, Americans emerge as the biggest supporters of free expression among the 38 nations studied. And unlike so many other issues in the U.S., wide open, free-ranging public debate has an appeal across party lines. There are relatively few differences between Democrats, Republicans and independents when it comes to free expression.\nHowever, there are some important generational differences on this issue. For instance, 40% of U.S. Millennials think the government should be able to prevent people from making statements that are offensive to minority groups, compared with 27% of those in Generation X, 24% of Baby Boomers, and just 12% of Silent Generation Americans. Nonwhite respondents (38%) are also more likely to hold this view than whites (23%).\nApart from debates over whether offensive language should be legal, most Americans believe people are just too easily offended nowadays. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey , 59% agreed with the statement \u201cToo many people are easily offended these days over the language that others use,\u201d while only 39% said \u201cpeople need to be more careful about the language they use to avoid offending people with different backgrounds.\u201d\nOn this question, however, there is a sharp partisan divide. Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans (78%) and 68% of independents say people are too easily offended these days, compared with just 37% of Democrats. And supporters of the major party nominees see this issue very differently. Among registered voters, 83% of Donald Trump supporters believe too many people are easily offended; only 39% of Hillary Clinton voters agree."], "citation_links": ["https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/americans-more-tolerant-of-offensive-speech-than-others-in-the-world/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_ac311338-a65b-41c7-8efd-f669d249188e"}

The Brennan Center for Justice has documented cases of wealthy donors using super PACs to gain access to and influence over the political process, and has warned that the current campaign finance system is in far worse shape. Congress should take steps to ensure that super PACs are not used to influence the political process.", "references": ["Congress is on the brink of passing the biggest stimulus bill in history. The last time there was legislation like this, super PACs didn\u2019t exist. Today, the campaign finance regulation system is in far worse shape, and wealthy donors can use their influence to try to obtain big payouts from the government.\nMeanwhile, the influence of unlimited big money has already been affecting the 2020 election. The evidence is everywhere from one donor spending nearly $15 million through a super PAC backing one primary candidates to the presidential contenders arguing at a debate about accepting money from wealthy supporters through super PACs.\nThe law limits the amount one individual can donate directly to a campaign, in part because of fears that that type of transaction could lead to corruption. But wealthy donors are still able to exert immense influence over our political process, thanks in part to a federal appeals court decision 10 years ago this month that was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling .\nIn SpeechNow v. Federal Election Commission , the DC Circuit Court of Appeals required the FEC to allow organizations to register as \u201cindependent expenditure only committees,\u201d a status that lets groups raise unlimited money from donors. Millionaires, billionaires, and corporations skirt individual limits by donating to these groups, which we now know as super PACs.\nThe groups \u2014 which are often staffed by former employees of the candidates \u2014 throw their money and resources behind candidates or political causes favored by the wealthy donors. The process drowns out the voices of regular voters, giving the superrich a level of access to and influence over the political process that\u2019s impossible for the vast majority of Americans to obtain. Examples abound over the last decade.\nThe most recent high-profile one involves Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Ukrainian-American businessmen who used large contributions to a pro-Trump super PAC to get facetime with the president. They took the opportunity to advocate for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a move they viewed as benefiting their own interests and those of another Ukrainian government official.\nOr there\u2019s the case of Jose Susumo Azano Matsura, a Mexican businessman interested in building a waterfront development in San Diego. He was convicted in 2016 of funneling $500,000 in illegal foreign money into a San Diego mayoral race to gain support for the project, using a shell company and super PAC to disguise the foreign source of much of the funds.\nReal estate was also a factor one year later on the east coast, when former Miami Beach Commissioner Michael Grieco pleaded no contest to charges resulting from a scheme that involved secretly setting up his own super PAC and accepting disguised donations from a Norwegian citizen interested in developing properties in the city.\nAnd just this month, North Carolina insurance magnate Greg Lindberg was convicted of attempting to bribe the state insurance commissioner to replace an official who was investigating a company Lindberg owned. The lion\u2019s share of the payments \u2014 $1.5 million \u2014 went through a super PAC Lindberg had created for the purpose. He was caught on tape explaining how his donations to a super PAC would benefit the insurance commissioner\u2019s campaign.\nThere are also cases where the influence of super PAC money was not outright illegal but has an appearance of corruption nonetheless.\nWhen Congress was considering an unpopular tax reform package in 2017, Cory Bliss \u2014 the head of the Congressional Leadership Fund and close ally of House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2014 gave House Republicans an ultimatum: the group would not support members who voted against the bill. As the tax reform moved through Congress, senators and representatives were frank about their motivation to pass it to please donors . The Congressional Leadership Fund went on to be the highest-spending super PAC in 2018, shelling out $138 million in support of GOP candidates.\nAnd in Washington, DC, supporters of Mayor Muriel Bowser were forced to shut down their super PAC when scandal erupted over big contributions from donors seeking business contracts with the district. One donor described giving to the super PAC this way : \u201cIf you want to continue to have good favor with the mayor, it is something you do.\u201d\nJust 11 donors have given $1 billion to super PACs over the years, and more than two-thirds of super PAC funding comes from donations of $1 million or more . Super PAC spending has sharply risen from $600 million in 2012 to over $1 billion in 2016.\nFortunately, powerful reform options are available. The key is public financing, which empowers regular people and the candidates they support to run competitive campaigns without seeking super PAC help. These programs match and multiply small donations with public funds, so that $50 from a constituent becomes worth $350 to the candidate, for example. The idea is not to eliminate big super PAC money, but to give candidates not supported by wealthy donors the resources to compete for office.\nPublic financing has seen success in several cities , from Los Angeles to New York City, where candidates raise most of their funds from small donors. The programs improve the connection between representative and constituent by rewarding retail fundraising in the community rather than ritzy fundraisers and wink-and-nod arrangements with super PACs. Several cities and counties have created public financing systems in response to Citizens United . A bill has also passed the House of Representatives. With every legislative advance, this reform can help our elections change course after a decade of super PACs."], "citation_links": ["https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/10-years-super-pacs-show-courts-were-wrong-corruption-risks"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_28d14136-17ed-4870-839e-9c707547705d"}

Others argue that baby boomers have not betrayed their children, but rather let them down.", "references": ["Baby boomers didn't rebuild the country after WW2\nIn recent news articles, the argument has been made for the baby boomer generation to do more to help the young, the millennial generation.\nThe replying argument from baby boomers is nicely summed up by Dennis Leech, the Emeritus professor of economics, in the Guardian. He stated that:\n\u201cThe baby boomer generation inherited one of the highest levels of public debt in British history: 240 per cent of GDP, following the war. They got that down to under 32 per cent by the 1990s\u2026they paid higher taxes than today during most of their working lives probably had something to do with it, as well as economic growth and the full-employment policy of successive governments before 1979.\u201d\nIn other words, we should be thanking the baby boomer generation for curing the post-war ills, rather than condemning their current perceived lack of empathy for the young.\nThere is a fundamental problem with this argument, and it is centred on when the changes to the economy, housing, social reform and education occurred:\nThe baby boomer generation is defined as those born from 1946 to 1964, although some extend it to 1974 in the UK. A result of the baby boom that occurred after the end of the second world war when soldiers came back and started families.\nNow, relate that to the public debt argument given above Dennis Leech, the Emeritus professor of economics. The debt of the 240 per cent was the rate straight after the second world war (see chart), before a single baby from generation baby boomer had reached their first birthday; even the most optimistic economist could not call this generation at the time \u2018economic active\u2019.\nBy the time the first baby boomer was economically active at eighteen years old the debt to GDP ratio had reduced from 240 per cent to 85 per cent \u2014 cut by the third. By the time the last baby boomer had reached eighteen, it was down to 43 per cent: It was the parents of baby boomers who had done the hard work in reducing public debt by growing the economy, not the baby boomer generation.\nThis applies to the economy generally; by the time the last baby boomer had reached the ages of being economically active, the post-war economic miracle had come and gone. Rather than being the creators of that economic revolution, they were, by being in their formative years while it occurred, the principal beneficiaries of the economic growth.\nThe same rule applies for social and economic policies. From 1946 to the early 1970s, the period baby boomers were still dependents, the structures of the post-war society had been put firmly into place: The core structures of the NHS were put into place immediately post-war.\nThe mass building of the new universities were in place for the lucky baby boomers to attend. And in an unprecedented cross-party movement, hundreds of thousands of houses were created by both the Labour and Conservative Governments (see chart), meaning that the baby boomers would be raised in the modern homes of today, rather than the widespread slums of pre-war Britain.\nThe same, again, applies regarding the employment and pension law, be it the Wages Councils Act 1945 or the Wages Councils Act 1948, the Wages Councils Act 1959 or the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, or the post-war pension reform, the baby boomers were the benefactors of the society so powerfully instigated by Sir William Beveridge in his report:\n\u201cThe scheme proposed here is in some ways a revolution, but in more important ways it is a natural development from the past. It is a British revolution.\u201d\nTo be clear, it was the house building, healthcare services, education services, working hours legislation and pension law, that was put into place by the parents of the baby boomers that allowed the baby boomers to get educated, buy their homes, have generous pensions and live longer than any generation before.\nIt is a debt to their altruistic parent\u2019s generation, baby boomers should be grateful.\nFor the baby-boomers, it is not until the 1980s that the last baby-boomer reaches eighteen. It is the decades of the eighties to the noughties that the baby-boomers should be expounding as the ones where their influence grew strong.\nAnd it is in this very period that saw the slow dismantling of all the post-war reforms that their parents had put in place. In a paradigmatical shift, the housing wasn\u2019t built, working and pension legislation weakened, the list goes on. After gaining the access to a better world from the action of their parents, baby boomers drew up the drawbridge.\nIt is essential that we understand that we create the framework in our society for the success of future generations, the idea that the baby boomers worked harder than their parent\u2019s post-war generation, and therefore deserved greater pensions and earnings than their parents is blatantly crass and evidentially wrong.\nNo, the baby boomers enjoyed a better work/life balance, housing, pension schemes and health care provision because it had been instilled into the structure of society by their parent\u2019s generation.\nIn slowly dismantling that hard earned structure it is their parents\u2019 dream of creating a fairer, more equal world that the baby boomers have ultimately let down.\nRanjit Sidhu is is the founder of SiD, Statistics into Decisions.

It was first performed by Andrea Bocelli at the 1995 Sanremo Music Festival and recorded on his album of the same year, Bocelli . The single was first released as an A-side single with \" Vivere \" in 1995, topping the charts, first in France, where it became one of the best-selling singles of all-time , and then in Belgium, breaking the all-time record sales there.\nA second version of the song, sung partly in English, released in 1996 as \" Time to Say Goodbye \", paired Bocelli with British soprano Sarah Brightman , and achieved even greater success, topping charts all across Europe, including Germany, where it became the biggest-selling single in history. Brightman and Bocelli produced a version with Brightman singing in German and Bocelli in Italian, with this version being available on the CD Time to Say Goodbye . [1] [2] That version alone has now sold more than 12 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time . [3]\nBocelli also recorded a full Spanish version of the song in 1997, titled \"Por ti volar\u00e9\" (\"For You I Will Fly\").\nAll through three versions, the song is considered Bocelli's signature song .\nThe song's original single release by Polydor Records was not commercially successful in Italy, and received little radio airplay there. Elsewhere it was a massive hit. In France and Switzerland, the single topped the charts for six weeks, earning a triple Gold sales award. In Belgium, it became the biggest hit of all-time, spending 12 weeks at No. 1. [4]\nPan-European magazine Music & Media wrote about the song, \"The Benelux triumph of poppy tenor Andrea Bocelli continues with this excellent seasonal anthem, which wisely leaves the singers classically trained voice in the spotlight. The orchestral arrangements take a back seat, as they should in Bocelli's case.\" [5] After Sarah Brightman released her version, Larry Flick from Billboard stated that she \"has one of the truly glorious voices in musical theater\". He described the song as a \"lushly orchestral piece\". [6] British magazine Music Week rated the duet version five out of five, picking it as Single of the Week. They added, \"Mostly sung in Italian, it has a beautiful, soaring melody that gives it true Nessun Dorma potential.\" [7]\n|Chart (1990s)||Position|\n|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) [19]||16|\n|Region||Certification||Certified units /sales|\n|Belgium ( BEA ) [20]||Platinum||50,000 *|\n|France||\u2014||900,000 [21]|\n|Italy ( FIMI ) [22]||Gold||25,000|\n|United Kingdom ( BPI ) [23]||Silver||200,000|\n* Sales figures based on certification alone.\nProblems playing this file? See media help .\nIn Germany, East West Records , in conjunction with Polydor, marketed a lyrically-changed version of \"Con te partir\u00f2\", retitled \" Time to Say Goodbye \", as the theme song for the final match of boxer Henry Maske (then the light-heavyweight champion of the International Boxing Federation ), having seen previous success when Vangelis 's \" Conquest of Paradise \" was also promoted via Maske's fights. \"Time to Say Goodbye\" was also turned into a duet with Sarah Brightman , who had performed \" A Question of Honour \" for one of Maske's previous fights. German producer Frank Peterson , who has worked with Brightman since 1991, opted to give the song an English title rather than the German title \"Mit dir werde ich fortgehen\". [24] Recording of the song took place at Peterson's Nemo Studio, in Hamburg . [25]\nThe match took place on 23 November 1996, pitting Maske against American Virgil Hill , and drew a television broadcast audience of over 21 million. Bocelli and Brightman performed the song to open the match, and it was used again during Maske's exit. [24]\nBy December, the \"Time to Say Goodbye\" single, released on 15 November 1996 through East West, had reached number one on the German singles chart , with sales estimated at 40,000\u201360,000 per day and projected for at least one million by the end of the year. Both singers' albums also received a boost in sales. Airplay on German radio stations such as Norddeutscher Rundfunk was well received by listeners. [24] By February of the following year, the single had broken the all-time sales record in Germany with 1.65 million sales, [26] and would eventually get certified 11x Gold for selling over 2,750,000 copies. [27]\n\"Time to Say Goodbye\" reached number two on the UK Singles Chart upon its release there in May 1997, and was certified Gold. [28] It remained in the top 30 for another two months, helped by steady radio airplay on BBC Radio 2 , which was overtaking Radio 1 in popularity with an MOR -orientated playlist. [29]\nThe duet was included on Brightman's 1997 album Timeless , re-titled as Time to Say Goodbye in the U.S. with the song itself moved to the start of the album. [25] Brightman has also recorded a solo version, which was released on the duet single as well as later albums including Classics and Diva: The Singles Collection . A live version was released on The Harem World Tour: Live from Las Vegas CD as well as her various tour DVDs.

Seven of the candidates have not qualified for the primetime debate.\nUpdated at 7:40 p.m.\nThe biggest punches thrown at the first GOP presidential debate of the evening were at candidates not on the consolation debate stage.\nSpeaking to a nearly completely empty arena in Cleveland, the seven candidates who didn't make the cut for the main debate stage \u2014 Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore \u2014 not only tried to make their views known but took jabs at the top tier candidates who will debate later Tuesday evening.\nFirst off the bat, Fox News moderators Bill Hemmer and Martha MacCallum asked candidates why the boisterous Trump was on the prime-time debate stage and they weren't. Many had been bitter over the polling methods used to determine who made the cut and who didn't. But others, like Fiorina and Graham, tried to put a happier spin on the evening, calling it the \"Happy Hour Debate.\"\nSponsor Message\nThe whole nearly 90-minute event was more like a forum than a real debate \u2014 candidates mostly stuck to talking points and stump speeches.\nLater, some took shots at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich for not being conservative enough. But no one lobbed attacks at any of their rivals on the 5 p.m. stage.\nAnd try as they might to draw criticism to their higher-polling rivals, right off the bat they had to answer their own weakness as well \u2014 why they had slipped in polling or not yet caught fire, and why some of them, with little to no name recognition, were even running.\nFiorina seemed to emerge the best from the debate, touting her business and foreign experience while taking jabs at Trump and Bush. She was leading on Google Trends after the debate, and Zignal Labs found in a real-time analysis that she was picked as the winner. While Fiorina has gotten rave reviews on the campaign trail, that still hasn't translated into poll numbers for her yet.\nOur real-time recap of the debate is below. Check out NPR's live chat too for more.\n7:40 p.m. We calculated the candidates' final talking times:\n1. Santorum: 7:48\nSponsor Message\n2. Fiorina: 7:46\n3. Perry: 7:06\n4. Pataki: 6:42\n5. Graham: 6:33\n6. Jindal: 6:05\n7. Gilmore: 5:24\n6:20 p.m. Each candidate's closing statements in brief:\nPerry: Texas is a success story, and I'd bring that to the White House\nSantorum: I'll look out for the American worker and will reduce immigration.\nJindal: We don't have to abandon our conservative principles to win, and I can unite the country. Jindal also took a shot at Bush's assertion that Republicans have to \"lose the primary to win the general.\"\nFiorina: I can \"throw every punch\" against Hillary Clinton, and I'm not a professional politician. (She also appeared to leave her closing statement on a hotel printer , as spotted by Rand Paul's spokesman Sergio Gor.)\nGraham: I can be commander in chief on Day 1 and win the fight against ISIS.\nPataki: I delivered in a blue state like New York and I can deliver for the country.\nGilmore: I have the experience as a prosecutor, military veteran and governor to be president.\n6:10 p.m. The candidates are asked to describe Hillary Clinton in two words (spoiler alert: they all used more than two words). Here's how they responded.\nPataki: \"Divisive and with no vision. No vision at all.\" \u2014 9 words\nFiorina: \"Not trustworthy. No accomplishment.\" \u2014 4 words\nSantorum: \"Secretive and untrustworthy.\" \u2014 3 words\nPerry: \"Let's go with three. Good at email.\" \u2014 7 words\nJindal: \"Socialist and government-dependent.\" \u2014 4 words\nGraham: \"Not the change we need at the time we need it.\" \u2014 11 words\nGilmore: \"Professional politician that can't be trusted.\" \u2014 6 words\n6:07 p.m. Rapid-fire questions reveal a place where all the candidates agree \u2014 they'd all tear up President Obama's executive orders on their first day in office.\n6:03 p.m. When asked whether defunding Planned Parenthood would play into Democratic attacks about \"The War on Women,\" Graham manages to pivot to saying the real war on women is in the Middle East, reminding voters he would send troops in to protect those areas and fight back ISIS. Foreign policy is obviously where Graham is the most comfortable.\nSponsor Message\n5:59 p.m. MacCallum points out Pataki is the only pro-choice candidate running. He tries to clarify and says he's personally opposed to abortion but says Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. He says he would support defunding Planned Parenthood though amid the recent controversy over videos that allege to show them selling fetal parts.\n5:52 p.m. Santorum gets the question about same-sex marriage. A vocal critic of such marriages, he says it isn't settled law despite the Supreme Court's decision this month and says it's the product of a \"rogue Supreme Court.\" He also equates it to the 1852 Dred Scott decision that effectively legalized slavery by finding blacks weren't U.S. citizens, which was eventually overturned by the 13th and 14th Amendments. Many conservatives hope another constitutional amendment could overturn same-sex-marriage legalization, too.\n5:48 p.m. It took almost 50 minutes for the Iran nuclear deal to come up in this debate. Perry is asked the first question and says he would \"tear up the deal.\" He also seems to imply he would make Fiorina his secretary of state, saying he would trust her negotiating this deal more than current Secretary of State John Kerry. Fiorina has touted her international experience and travels over Hillary Clinton when she was a Fortune 500 CEO.\n5:42 p.m. Jindal takes an implied shot at Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who will be on the main debate stage. Kasich made the decision \u2014 unpopular with conservatives \u2014 to expand Medicaid in his state. Kasich has drawn on his faith for his rationale in doing so. Jindal says he wouldn't have done it, though. \"I don't think anybody should expand Medicaid,\" he says.\nPataki also jumps in and says he thinks Medicaid expansion is wrong and he wouldn't have done it in New York, either.\nKasich has pitched the importance of Ohio (no Republican has won the White House without it) as a reason he should be the nominee. But this exchange shows there's still a lot of skepticism of him on the right, and similar questions are likely to come up at 9 p.m. too.\nSponsor Message\n5:38 p.m. Santorum says he will soon introduce a \"20/20 Vision\" plan for the economy that would \"take a blowtorch to the IRS\" and include a 20 percent flat tax and increase manufacturing in the country. Santorum often gets stereotyped as simply a social issues candidate, but he has a blue collar appeal \u2014 how he got elected in Pennsylvania and how he was able to have a run of success in 2012.\n5:37 p.m. Time for the economy. Graham turns the question to hit Hillary Clinton \u2014 something the party would like all candidates to do. \"I know the difference between being flat broke. Clinton doesn't.\" He also cleaned up an anecdote he used on Monday's New Hampshire forum . Saying he knows \"Clintonspeak\" well, this time he says only if Bill Clinton asks \"what the meaning of is, is\" then \"he did.\" On Monday, he came outright and claimed the former president had sex with intern Monica Lewinsky \u2014 one of the biggest zingers of the night.\n5:28 p.m. Santorum, a hard-liner on immigration, is asked what he would do about DREAMers in the country. He uses a line that's frequent from his stump speech \u2014 how his grandfather came here from Italy, dreaming of a new life. But he did it legally. \"We're a country of laws, not of men,\" says Santorum.\nPerry is also asked about immigration, and he draws, as usual, on his experience as governor of Texas, reiterating securing the border.\n5:15 p.m. Time for the elephant that isn't in the room \u2014 and these participants hoped wouldn't be here \u2014 psych! Perry is asked about Trump, whom he's been unapologetic in attacking. Perry looks surprised but doesn't back down. He points out that Trump has changed his position on health care.\nFiorina jabs at a Washington Post report that Bill Clinton called Trump before he got in. She's careful not to insult him too much, pointing out he taps into an anger people identify with, but piggybacks on Perry's point that Trump once supported health care reform and also once supported abortion rights.\nSponsor Message\n5:09 p.m. Following the same line of questioning, Graham is pressed on whether he's too moderate. And Pataki and Gilmore \u2014 at the bottom of the polls \u2014 are asked whether it's time for new blood in politics. Pataki hasn't held office since 2006; Gilmore was last in office in 2002.\n5:06 p.m. The Fox News moderators are going for the jugular. They start off by asking Fiorina whether her own comparisons to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are off base given her low standing in the polls. Santorum is asked whether his moment since his incredible 2012 surge has passed. And Jindal is pressed on his poor approval ratings at home. Tough questions off the bat \u2014 but they highlight each of the candidates' top weaknesses.\n5:01 p.m. First question goes to Perry \u2014 who was atop the polls at this time in 2011 but famously flamed out, in part due to his poor debate performances. Perry argues the four years since as governor have made him more prepared. \"Americans are going to see I'm ready to be that individual,\" said Perry.\nBut this is his biggest hurdle \u2014 reintroducing himself to voters. It's hard to make a first impression a second time."], "citation_links": ["https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/06/430077174/republicans-face-off-in-happy-hour-consolation-debate"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_92c8b7fa-a90a-4568-9ecc-a417d8c06215"}

Here's a list of his best performances against every team in the Association.\nESPN\nBy Max Golkin , PSO Asst. Director of Basketball Personnel\nMay 23, 2020\nMay 23, 2020\nInspired by ESPN\u2019s 30 for 30 documentary series \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d, now is the perfect time to compile a list of Jordan\u2019s best games against every team in the NBA. Michael Jordan is widely considered the greatest player of all-time . He\u2019s had more success than any player during his generation and thrived vs. every single team in the league. Let\u2019s take a look at his most outstanding performances against every NBA team.\nApril 16th, 1987 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThe \u201986-\u201987 season was MJ\u2019s breakout year, averaging a career-best 37.1 points per game (which hasn\u2019t been matched since). He was forced to carry a talent-limited Bulls team to a 40-42 record and the eighth seed in the East that season. Jordan exploded in this game against Atlanta, scoring 61 points (tying his regular season career-high at that point) on 22-38 shooting, adding 10 rebounds, and four steals. The Hawks still found a way to win the game. Atlanta outscored the Bulls 37-23 in the final period to grab the win, their 57th of the season. Hall of Famer Dominque Wilkins went for 34 points.\nApril 20th, 1986 \u2013 Eastern Conference First Round Game 3\nIn his second season, Jordan missed the majority of the year with a broken foot. He was able to get back on the court in time for the Playoffs, with his Bulls meeting up with the top-seeded Boston Celtics led by Larry Bird in the first round. Chicago was no match for the Celtics, who would eventually win the title, but that didn\u2019t stop Jordan from putting on a show.\nAfter a 49-point performance in Game 1, he followed that up in Game 2 in Boston with a Playoff career-high 63 points as they went to double-overtime . Unfortunately, Chicago lost the game, 135-131, but Jordan\u2019s performance still stands as the most points scored by ANY player in NBA Postseason history. However, Chicago would get swept in three straight games.\nFebruary 26th, 1987 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nBefore the Nets were in Brooklyn, they called New Jersey home where Michael Jordan had one of the greatest plays of his career . Jordan\u2019s greatest game against the Nets came during a 128-113 victory with MJ exploding for 58 points that included a near perfect 26-for-27 effort from the free throw line. The GOAT didn\u2019t have much help from his supporting cast that night as Chicago\u2019s next leading scoring John Paxson only added 16 points.\nDecember 29th, 2001- Regular Season Game\nAfter establishing himself as the unquestioned best player in the game, Michael Jordan took a three-year hiatus before taking his talents to Washington D.C. to play for the Wizards. While still maintaining a scoring average over 20 PPG in DC, he was essentially a shell of his former MVP self. However, he managed to score over 45 points once during his time in the nation\u2019s capital and it was against the only other organization he would end up aligning with besides the Wizards and the Bulls.\nJanuary 19th, 2002- Regular Season Game\nJordan made his highly-anticipated return to the United Center in Wizards blue and white. It was his first time in the visiting locker room. When the starting lineups were announced, Jordan received a three-minute long ovation as Chicago remembered the iconic moments he provided. Though Jordan would only score 16 points in his return to the Windy City, this game deserves a spot on this list due to its significance.\nIn Jordan\u2019s interview after the game, he stated, \u201cwhen the crowd started that whole thing, it made it tough for me to play,\u201d Jordan admitted. \u201cI had a tough time playing against Chicago. It\u2019s like playing a relative, in a sense. It\u2019s not as intense, you\u2019re not quite as motivated.\u201d Jordan\u2019s 16.2 PPG against the Bulls over six games is by far the lowest average against any team he\u2019s ever faced.\nMarch 28th, 1990 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nOne could understandably choose \u201cThe Shot\u201d as MJ\u2019s best game, but putting up almost 70 points in a game deserves recognition too. Considering Michael Jordan scored a career-best 69 points in the Bulls 117-113 overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1990, it deserved to represent this spot on the list. Jordan shot a ludicrous 23-for-37 from the field and was 21-for-23 from the free-throw line as he put together an incredibly efficient scoring attack all game.\nApril 7th, 1990 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAlthough the Mavericks were never a rival of the Bulls, that didn\u2019t stop Michael from torching them for 43 points during their regular season matchup in 1990. MJ put up 43 points in 40 minutes on 15-26 shooting from the field and going 3-for-5 from three-point land. In 25 games against the Mavs, MJ averaged 27.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, & 5.5 APG.\nFebruary 4th, 1996 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nWith Chicago\u2019s record-breaking season on the line every night, the Bulls were down by 31 points late in the second quarter. However, when Michael Jordan is on the opposing team, no lead is safe. He scored 23 points in the third quarter alone as he brought the Bulls back and eventually took the lead. Unfortunately, they would end up losing 1 of their 10 games that season 105-98, but Jordan\u2019s second-half dominance was one for the books.\nMay 27th, 1989 \u2013 NBA Eastern Conference Finals Game 3\nWith the 1989 ECF series tied one-a-piece, the Bulls had home-court advantage for Game 3. Jordan dropped 46 points on 16-for-26 shooting and went 14-for-15 from the free throw line. Jordan added seven rebounds, dished five assists, and stole the ball five times in the Bulls\u2019 99-97 victory. Despite MJ\u2019s heroics to take a 2-1 lead in the series, however, the Bulls would lose the next three games and the series.\nNovember 24th, 1992 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThe most points Michael Jordan scored in a game against the Warriors was when he dropped 49 points in 1992 at Golden State. Jordan shot 18-of-30 from the field, including 1-of-3 from three-point range, and 12-of-14 from the free throw line. He also recorded five rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block in 44 minutes in the 101-92 Bulls victory. 20 years later, the Warriors were beginning to build the only dynasty that was able to win more games in a season than Jordan\u2019s Bulls.\nJanuary 3rd, 1996 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThis matchup featured the number one overall pick of the 1984 draft and the 3rd overall pick: Hakeem \u201cthe Dream\u201d Olajuwon vs. Michael \u201cAir\u201d Jordan. The Finals matchup fans never got to see. The 2x reigning champ Houston Rockets facing off against the previous 3x reigning champ Chicago Bulls before Jordan retired in 1993.\nMJ let it be known in this game that the Rockets have some competition if they want to 3-peat as he almost finished with 40 points in a near-blowout against Houston. The Rockets failed to beat the Sonics in the West Playoffs so they couldn\u2019t even defend their title against the Bulls later that year.\nApril 13th, 1989 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nThe Chicago Bulls were taking on the Indiana Pacers late in the 1988-89 season, with Chicago vying for playoff positioning and the Pacers just playing out the rest of their schedule. As a temporary Point Guard, Jordan posted a monster triple-double, scoring 47 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds but the Bulls still lost by 4.\nNovember 21st, 1997 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAs he was getting into his mid-30\u2019s, Michael Jordan continued to play phenomenal during the 1997-98 regular season as he won his fifth MVP . On this November night, he scored 49 points against the Clippers in Los Angeles. MJ played a total of 52 minutes in the game, helping the Bulls secure the double-overtime win with Scottie Pippen out of action.\nJune 5th, 1991 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 2\nIn the NBA Finals, MJ displayed all the tools that made him one of the most complete basketball players on the planet \u2013 while sharing the court with Magic Johnson. After struggling in Game 1, Air Jordan responded with 33 points on an incredible 83.3 FG% to go along with 13 assists, 7 rebounds, 1 block, and 2 steals. The Bulls rode the momentum of this game to win the next three games, as Michael Jordan celebrated the first Championship of his career a week later.\nNov. 30th, 1995 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nMichael Jordan\u2019s highest-scoring game against the Grizzlies came in Vancouver on Nov. 30, 1995. He scored 29 points on 14-for-26 shooting from the field and 1-for-2 from the free-throw line. Jordan saved his best for last, leading the Bulls to a comeback win by scoring 19 points in the game\u2019s final six minutes. Besides facing Chicago, the two franchises Jordan struggled most against throughout his career were Vancouver (22.7 PPG) and Toronto (20.5 PPG), the NBA\u2019s only Canadian teams.\nApril 29th, 1992 \u2013 Eastern Conference First Round Game 3\nThe Bulls were leading the Heat 2-0 in the series of the 1992 Playoffs 1st Round and looking to close things out in Miami. Heading into the fourth quarter, Chicago trailed 80-79. Not only did Jordan have an amazing performance, but he and Pippen were fantastic as a duo. The two players combined to score 87 points with 56 coming from Jordan as they won the game 119-114 and eliminated the Heat from the postseason.\nFebruary 16th, 1989 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nWith the Bucks leading the Bulls by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter, Michael Jordan displayed the brilliance everyone knew he was capable of. Jordan hit the GOAT-mode switch and dropped 27 points in that final period to rack up 50 overall, to go along with eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals, and it\u2019s even more impressive considering how he did it. Despite trailing for the entire second half, the game-winner came from Michael Jordan\u2019s hands as he knocked down a mid-range jumper with one second left on the clock.\nApril 3rd, 1998 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAs people could see from the documentary, Michael Jordan was on a mission during his \u201cLast Dance\u201d season. The Bulls matchup with the Timberwolves was a great example of Jordan showing his masterful offensive game. MJ dropped 41 points on 16-25 shooting from the field as the Bulls beat the Timberwolves 107-93. \u2018Air Jordan\u2019 can be seen getting buckets from all over the court in the highlights of his excellent performance.\nMarch 28th, 1995 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nMichael Jordan made it clear multiple times throughout his career that he shines brightest on the biggest stage. There is no bigger stage in the NBA than Madison Square Garden in the most populated city in the country. Jordan had many significant performances against the Knicks, but his most memorable game came just five games after he announced \u201cI\u2019m Back\u201d in 1995. With a star-studded group in attendance, MJ put on a show, dropping 55 points, and came away with the game-winning assist as the Bulls won 113-111.\nMay 27th, 1996 \u2013 Eastern Conference Finals Game 6\nThe Bulls went into Game 4 in Orlando with a 3-0 series lead, needing just one win to sweep the Magic out of the playoffs. While Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Penny Hardaway each had good games with 28 points a piece, Michael Jordan was on another level. He dropped 45 points on 16-for-23 shooting from the field, giving the Bulls a 106-101 victory and closing out the series, officially avenging their only postseason series loss after 1991.\nJanuary 13th, 1996 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nEntering this game, Chicago was 29-3 while the 76ers were a dreadful 7-25, so it was pretty clear who was likely to win. The real question was by how much, and how much would MJ score in the victory? The answer: Jordan posted 48 points on 18-28 shooting, and was perfect from line (7-7). The Bulls dominated the Sixers all evening, ending it with a 120-93 victory.\nJune 6th, 1993 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 4\nAfter winning the first two games of the 1993 NBA Finals against the Phoenix Suns, Chicago lost Game 3 in Phoenix and tried to avoid allowing the Suns to tie the series in Game 4. Knowing the importance of the situation, MJ went off for 55 points on 21-for-37 shooting while adding eight rebounds and four assists. The Bulls completed a 111-105 win, taking a commanding 3-1 series lead that they would finish in six games.\nJune 3rd, 1992 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 1 (The Shrug Game)\nWith the media comparing Clyde Drexler to the great Michael Jordan , the GOAT took that disrespect to the court by coming out firing in Game 1. The United Center was buzzing after his third 3-pointer and nearly exploded after his fourth. Then came the fifth, all in the first half. Jordan was truly letting it fly from deep. After hitting his SIXTH three-pointer of the game, Jordan couldn\u2019t help but shrug toward Magic Johnson who was commentating the game, and it became iconic.\nHis six three-pointers were a Finals record for a single half, as was his 35 points. He would finish with 39 on the night as he rested for a large part of the second half of a 33-point victory. Jordan\u2019s Bulls would go on to win the series in six games, establishing him as a back-to-back NBA Champion for the first time.\nNovember 23rd, 1997 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nIn 1997, Jordan scored 33 points against the Kings in a game that Chicago beat Sacramento by a final score of 126-108. Jordan shot 11-19 from the field and went 11-12 from the line. This was about a month into their \u201cLast Dance\u201d season before they really kicked it into gear en route to winning a third straight NBA championship to end his career.\nNovember 13th, 1984 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nIn Michael Jordan\u2019s rookie season, he immediately showed the league what he was truly capable of. The Bulls were 6-2 going into a home game against the Spurs and \u2018Air Jordan\u2019 put on the best performance of his young career thus far by dropping his first of many 40-point games. The Bulls snuck out of Chicago with a 120-117 win and the clear realization that they have a superstar on their squad.\nJune 16th, 1996 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 6\nBefore moving to Oklahoma City, the Thunder franchise was based in Seattle as the Supersonics or simply referred to as the \u201cSonics.\u201d Gary Payton\u2019s squad had quite a few run-ins with Jordan and his Bulls. Michael Jordan would win his first title since returning from baseball during their historic 1995-96 season as he finished it off with 22 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists on Father\u2019s Day as the Chicago Bulls won their fourth Championship in franchise history (all with Jordan).\nNovember 7th, 1995 \u2013 Regular Season Game\nAs noted above in the Grizzlies section, Jordan didn\u2019t always play his best when facing Canadian teams. However, he did manage to drop 38 points on two separate occasions against the Raptors. His best all-around performance came early in the 1995-96 season when he led the Bulls to a nine-point victory with an efficient shooting performance (13-for-19 FG) to go alongside a well-balanced five assists, four rebounds, and four steals.\nJune 14th, 1998 \u2013 NBA Finals Game 6\nMichael Jordan\u2019s best game against the Jazz can also be considered his greatest game ever. It may not be the game where he posted the greatest numbers, but the way this one went down will forever be legendary. In Jordan\u2019s last game as a Bull, he was required to shoot an extraordinary 35 shots thanks to an injured Scottie Pippen.\nMJ finished his Bulls career with 45 points and put the finishing touches on the greatest sequence to end a Finals game in NBA history. With the Jazz owning a three-point lead with about 30 seconds left before forcing a Game 7, Jordan scored a quick layup, stole the ball, and capped it off with the the game-winning jumper to earn his sixth and final Championship, reaching unanimous GOAT status."], "citation_links": ["https://prosportsoutlook.com/michael-jordans-best-game-vs-each-nba-team/"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_4d55db5a-b99a-4493-a02e-7b89295fdfdc"}

It required further development. Europe\u2019s move to monetary integration with a common currency (the euro) is quite a unique process. It is also held up as a model for monetary cooperation in other parts of the world: in the Gulf region, where there are periodic discussions of monetary unification, as well as in Asia and Latin America, where movements towards greater monetary integration also have some support but encounter a plethora of difficulties. Nevertheless, no later than the onset of the global financial crisis (2007-08), it became clear that there were substantial design flaws in the concept of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).\nThere was always ambiguity in the story of European monetary integration: Was it designed to deal with a technical issue, i.e. exchange rate volatility as a barrier to trade and thus to greater economic integration? Was it a quest for price stability? Or was it part of a grand political plan, in which money was used to tie the European knot? In the 1960s, US-based economists (Mundell in 1961, McKinnon in 1963 and Kenen in 1969) developed a theory of optimum currency areas. Although they continued to be influential figures in the European debate, their theories were irrelevant to the final push to monetary integration in the 1990s. The states that signed up to the economic union had different expectations and hopes: Some saw it as a way of building credibility and thus of reducing borrowing costs, while others focused on the constitutionalisation of a stable monetary regime. How could the divergent visions of the potential gains from monetary integration be mutually reconciled?\nThe European uniqueness after 1999 lay in the creation of a common currency without a corresponding state structure. Previously money had been seen as a creation or even property of the state. Europe, however, had a currency without a state. This could easily be considered a source of intractable problems. As a consequence, when a crisis arose, it was hard to work out whether it came from the peculiar features of a monetary union (that might require institutional completion), or from the pattern familiar elsewhere of capital inflows that encountered a sudden stop and then a reversal.\nIt is easy to see this feature as the fundamental design flaw. It is often claimed \u2013 especially but not only by American economists \u2013 that the travails of the euro, as well as the history of past monetary unions, show that it is impossible to have a monetary union in the absence of a political union, which establishes a common political process for determining the distribution of fiscal costs. 1 The latest version of the critique comes from Mody. 2 De Grauwe stated the case quite simply: \u201cThe euro is a currency without a country. To make it sustainable, a European country has to be created\u201d. 3 Successive Presidents of the European Central Bank (ECB) seem to endorse much of this advice, but perhaps more rhetorically than practically. Accepting the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Jean-Claude Trichet said, \u201cIn a long term historical perspective, Europe \u2013 which has invented the concept and the word of democracy \u2013 is called to complete the design of what it already calls a \u2018Union\u2019\u201d. 4 Mario Draghi has been even more dramatic, demanding \u201cthe collective commitment of all governments to reform the governance of the euro area\u201d. This means completing the economic and monetary union along four key pillars:\n- a financial union with a single supervisor at its heart, to reunify the banking system;\n- a fiscal union with enforceable rules to restore fiscal capacity;\n- an economic union that fosters sustained growth and employment;\n- a political union, where the exercise of shared sovereignty is rooted in political legitimacy. 5\nThis advice seems appallingly radical to many, since almost every politician denies that there is any real possibility of creating something resembling a European state, and almost every citizen recoils at the prospect. The fact that the discussion that Draghi contributed to had been going on for decades suggests that there were no easy solutions. 6\nA second design flaw lies in the quite divergent views or philosophies in Europe about how to manage the process of integration. The German, or more generally, northern vision is about rules, rigor, and consistency, while the French or southern emphasis is on the need for flexibility, adaptability and innovation. Specific policy preferences follow from the general orientation: The rule-based approach worries a great deal about the destruction of value and insolvency as well as about avoiding bailouts that will set a bad example and encourage inadequate behaviour among other actors (commonly referred to by economists as the moral hazard problem). The discretionary approach sees many economic issues as temporary liquidity problems that can be solved easily with an injection of new lending. Here the provision of liquidity is costless: There is no bailout, no incurred loss, and in fact the knock-on effects make everyone better off. There are, in this vision, multiple possible states of the world, multiple equilibria, and the benign action of government and monetary authorities can shift the whole polity from a bad situation into a good one. To this, adherents of the moral hazard view point out the costs that will pile up in the future from the bad example that has just been set. The German view wants a greater coordination of national policies in a rule-based framework, echoing German federal traditions. France instead looks for united economic government, in line with that country\u2019s tradition of centralisation.\nThe design flaws go along with environmental or contingent circumstances. European growth prospects were poor even before the global financial crisis because of a mixture of demographic and organisational or institutional reasons. In 2007, the economic historian Robert Fogel predicted that per capita income in the old (15) members of the EU would grow by 1.2% annually, less than half the rate in the US (2.8%) and spectacularly less than India (6.0%) or China (8.0%). He thought that welfare spending and high taxes would handicap growth; he could have added the absence of the large IT giants who, in the US or China, looked as if they were driving growth and innovation. 7 The different corporate structure might be explained by the poorer development of the venture capital sector as well as by markets that were still segmented by national regulation and national politics. From 2018, a slowdown began in Europe which might be interpreted as evidence that German and other \u2018winners of globalisation\u2019 in engineering and automobiles were facing an increasingly unfriendly global environment as a result of both technical change and trade wars.\nAnother major vulnerability was exposed during the global financial crisis. European economies were much more dependent on banks than the US economy. Banks were a greater source of financing for productive activity (80% of external financing in Europe came from banks; in the US it was 20%). Banks were also much larger in relation to the national economy. In 2007, Deutsche Bank\u2019s assets were 80% of German GDP, BNP Paribas\u2019s were 87% of that of France, and Bank of Ireland\u2019s stood at 100% of the national GDP. The equivalent figures for the large banks in the US were 13% for Citigroup, or nine percent for JPMorgan Chase. In a crisis that was primarily related to banks, Europe would automatically be more vulnerable. 8\nBanks and governments were intertwined in Europe. Banks held large quantities of government debt \u2013 in particular, French, German and UK banks held large quantities of peripheral European debt, and in the course of the crisis, peripheral banks held larger amounts of their own government\u2019s debts. If that government debt became too large, and its amortisation and repayment became problematic, then the values would collapse and bring down banks. The banks would then need to be recapitalised by their own governments, adding to the sum of sovereign debt, and hence to the uncertainty over valuation. This relationship became a well-known stylised fact about Europe\u2019s financial dilemma, and was referred to as the \u2019doom loop\u2019. The initial outbreak of the Eurozone crisis was in Greece, where the domestic banks did not initially appear to be part of the problem (they became a central feature of the difficulty later) and therefore the doom loop did not feature so prominently in early analyses. Immediately after the Lehman collapse, the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr\u00fcck and Chancellor Angela Merkel made a joint announcement on 5 October 2008 in which they reassured German savers that their bank deposits were safe; but Steinbr\u00fcck also added that he would ensure that the burden would not be transferred from the banks to the taxpayer. The problem was that the bank weakness seemed to make it impossible to keep both of these promises.\nWhile the first decade of the euro was dominated by complacent thinking, partly fuelled by the belief that the fundamental global challenges lay in global imbalances, e.g. unsustainable surpluses in China and unsustainable deficits in the US, the second decade began with the threat that the bank-sovereign links in Europe constituted the key fault line in the global economy. Between the summer of 2011 and the summer of 2012, it looked likely that the euro might fall apart.\nIn December 2018, Draghi explained that the ECB was \u201cthe only driver of this recovery\u201d in parts of the Eurozone. 9 The ECB came to view itself and its vision in heroic terms. Almost all commentators trace the survival of the euro back to some off the cuff remarks Draghi made at the end of a press conference in July 2012. Then, similar to a previous period of enormous financial tension and fragility in December 2011 when the IMF was contemplating the need for very large fund programs, the ECB saved the day (or put off the day of reckoning) through the introduction of new facilities, the Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) and in 2012 the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs). The pendulum swung from concern about systemic vulnerability to thinking that the Eurozone problem was a case of two deep-seated national crises \u2013 in Greece arising out of an over-extended public sector, and in Italy as a consequence of low growth.\nThe Europeans then struggled with how they should view the Lender of Last Resort (LLR). Did a LLR simply supply liquidity or was it also important to correct the deeper institutional flaws (including governance failures) that made for vulnerability, slow growth and crisis? Was the European LLR the ECB, which would have the capacity theoretically to create infinite amounts of euros and hence credibility in dealing with market attacks but no mandate to impose conditionality and a self-understanding that stressed independence from political control? Or was it the IMF, a politically controlled and accountable multilateral institution but of global character, with a tradition of policy conditionality and a problem that its resources were finite? Both institutions had obvious flaws in their scope for LLR action, which would be sharply exposed in the course of the financial crisis.\nIt looked as if some blend of IMF and ECB procedures would be needed. A European version in which the European Stability Mechanism develops into a European Monetary Fund (EMF) might deal with the major challenges that still face Europe and its currency union. The first three challenges are technical-economic in nature, while the final one is concerned with political economy:\n- Current account imbalances\n- Debt sustainability\n- Conditionality and ownership\n- Security linkages and leadership\nThe first rationale for a new institutional framework looks back to the original intentions behind the Bretton Woods architecture. The question of adjustment in the international financial system has always been contentious, and the debate about international order at Bretton Woods was shaped by lessons drawn from the unsuccessful attempt to create a stable order after the First World War. The heart of the interwar problem was held to be asymmetric adjustment leading to a deflation bias. The surplus countries of the 1920s, France and the US, were under no pressure to expand, while the deficit countries were forced by the rules of the game to contract. It was easy to project that situation into the post-war world, where it looked as if there would be one country with a huge surplus for a very long time.\nThe issue of large surpluses has always \u2013 at least for fifty years \u2013 played a role in the European debate. Other European countries often worried about what they sometimes described as Germany\u2019s currency manipulation, which they saw as a mercantilist strategy of securing permanent trade and current account surpluses that would give Germany a commanding control of resources. In each phase of European monetary integration, Germany\u2019s partners in consequence tried to devise an institutional mechanism to control German surpluses, and they believed that an institutional move to Europeanisation would admirably do that job. It was the surge in German trade surpluses in the late 1960s that drove the original discussion of a European monetary union that culminated in the 1970 Werner Plan. In the later 1970s, angst about the German surpluses re-emerged and produced the European Monetary System (EMS) initiatives. In the late 1980s, the increase in the German surpluses pushed both the United States at the G-7 level and France at the European level to produce schemes for control. There is a path from Edouard Balladur\u2019s proposals to the Delors Committee to the Maastricht Treaty. Only in the 1990s were there no German surpluses: that was the consequence of German unification. German surpluses in the later 2000s formed the backdrop for much of the discussion of flaws in the euro area architecture.\nThe IMF, while it has often provided excellent analysis of imbalances on a global level, has never really found a satisfactory way of addressing the issue. An attempt in 2007 to strengthen exchange rate regime surveillance ran into the sands, because of Chinese opposition followed by the outbreak of the global financial crisis. In a European setting, imbalances could only be dealt with successfully by more extensive coordination of fiscal policies, and it is hard to see that the analytical side of an EMF would have the political heft to tackle the issue.\nThe second point relates to the more recent experience of the IMF. Over recent decades, a great deal of technical attention in the IMF had been devoted to, and a substantial competence developed in, the issue of debt management and debt sustainability. The view that debt sustainability was central grew out of extensive and painful involvement with over-indebted countries: with low income countries, but also with Latin American emerging markets in the 1980s and with East Asia in the later 1990s. The primary aim of the IMF\u2019s crisis management is to make a country\u2019s debt sustainable. That is, the country\u2019s future projected tax revenue minus its expenditure should be large enough to ensure that the country is able and willing to service its debt. In most cases, there is in truth no clear-cut answer to the apparently simple question, \u201cIs debt sustainable?\u201d Debt may be sustainable in some states of the world (strong growth, low interest rates) and unsustainable in others. In the course of the European debt crisis, the most difficult moments within the so-called troika have concerned the IMF\u2019s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).\nMany of the leading current proposals for the operation of the EMF suggest an automatic principle of debt reduction in the case of an adoption of a program. 10 The group of Nordic countries, including the Netherlands, informally known as the Hanseatic League 2.0 has set up a bailout scheme that includes automatic debt reductions. The European Commission\u2019s proposal, by contrast, does not envisage a sovereign restructuring (or any exit scheme from the euro), because of worries about contagious runs that might spread to countries so large that the existing backstops would be overwhelmed. If the proposal that linked EMF action to debt sustainability were to be realised, Europe would offer an example for how to fix a problem that is much more than simply a European one. It is also a problem that is likely to become more intense as the pressures of political populism lead countries to run larger deficits again.\nOver time, the IMF developed an approach to the politics of economic reform that made it uncomfortable with the enforcer or whipping boy role that it had traditionally been given by the international community (i.e. the big and powerful states). Since the 1990s, it had increasingly emphasised the idea of \u2018ownership\u2019 i.e. that reforms do not work unless they are carried by a deep political consensus. But the Europeans\u2019 motivation for calling in the IMF was precisely to find a substitute for the lacking consensus about economic reform.\nThe most problematic aspect of the troika arrangements was not so much the presence of the IMF, but the way that the central bank \u2013 a non-political and technocratic institution \u2013 was pushed into making political choices. Thus, the ECB was drawn deeper into political arguments. The effectiveness of the ECB\u2019s monetary promise in July 2012 (\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d) lay in the extent to which it had \u2013 and was believed by the markets to have \u2013 the backing of the German government. As in the case of the Asian discussion of the 1990s, IMF participation was crucial for the design of a country program. In this case, the lack of clarity about where, how and why the ultimate decisions would be made looked like both a problem of leadership and a problem of democratic accountability.\nThe politics of support for a broad array of economic reforms may raise issues different from those generated in a purely economic analysis. Bretton Woods was designed as a multilateral and multipolar system, the expression of the wartime coalition (the United Nations) in which security and economic stabilisation were joined at the hip. Today, there is an urgent need for a similarly connected governance structure at the global level, offering coordination between the profusion of regional bodies that characterise the improvised attempts of leaders to respond to governance challenges.\nToday, unipolarity is crumbling but the security challenges remain. The most complex contemporary financial crises \u2013 Ukraine or Venezuela \u2013 are also overshadowed by a distinct security dimension; and neither the security nor the financial dimension can be tackled on their own. Europe has its own non-economic vulnerability. The nature of the European problem was transformed in 2014-15, initially by the Russian occupation of the Crimea and the fighting in eastern Ukraine, and again in 2015 by the large-scale inflow of refugees from Syria and other areas. At first, it appeared as if the new problems would prove fatal to the European idea; but then some came to believe that the older debt issue was more easily solved in the context of multiple challenges. Brexit and Trump only increased that impression, and Europe \u2013 especially after the election of Emmanuel Macron as President of the French Republic \u2013 mobilised to produce a response. It looked as if Europe was having a \u2018leadership moment,\u2019 analogous to that taken so spectacularly by the US at Bretton Woods.\nAll of Europe\u2019s current problems and challenges require responses, and it is hard to see how each could effectively be handled by a separate grouping of countries in a disparate institution, in a coalition of the willing, or what the political scientist Jan Zielonka in 2014 called \u2018political polyphony\u2019. 11 In each case, some member countries will work out that they will gain from cooperation, but others will realize that they may lose from that particular instance of cooperation. Instead, an analogy from trade negotiations may be a useful way to think of solving the political side of some of Europe\u2019s problems. Trade negotiations have been a largely successful exercise in the second half of the twentieth century in which large welfare gains were realised in many areas. 12\nThe lesson from previous episodes of trade reform is in part a story of political framing as well as a story of compensatory deals. Countries can calculate that they might lose out on the solution to one of the issues but gain on another. For instance, Germany might have to pay some debt relief for Southern European countries but may also quickly benefit from a European solution to the refugee crisis. The presence of migrants \u2013 some from within, some from without \u2013 raises the case of how social security is provided. Military integration could raise the effectiveness of defence while cutting costs, especially in those countries with a high military budget. Europe would appear as an arena in which trade-offs and compromises were negotiated, rather than a place where precious concepts of sovereignty were destroyed. Making this sort of pact requires leadership.\nIt is the question of leadership that fundamentally divides Europe. The euro is divisive because it looks like a straitjacket. And the problem with the imposition of external constraints is that it establishes a psychological mechanism of blame transference. When the policy that results from those external constraints does not produce growth, then the euro is reinterpreted as a trap. When wage growth occurred despite the external constraint and growth faltered, there was no way out. The euro is thus responsible for trapping southern Europe into a low competitiveness scenario. France is suffering from the story that the French elite told when they wanted to join the single currency, namely that of a strong franc, which was nicely labelled the \u2018franc fort\u2019 obviously evoking Germany\u2019s financial centre.\nThe other side also feels that it is in a trap. Sometimes Germany is portrayed as the major beneficiary of the euro \u2013 especially in southern Europe. But Germans do not see the trade gains \u2013 especially when southern Europe is buying less German exports, fewer automobiles and machine tools as consumption and investment have both collapsed. They see instead the financial claims building up in the payments system; the TARGET2 balances that result from the counterpart to money transfers to the southern banking system.\nAs in the case of the global system, management cannot come from one country alone, as that would not be legitimate. Multilateral institutions are ways of both diffusing leadership and of making real leadership effective. But their role needs to be precisely defined. They can establish greater trust by monitoring commitment, e.g. assessing the viability and the sustainability of promises. This is precisely the role that Jean Tirole described in 2002 when he saw the IMF and other international institutions as \u2019delegated monitors\u2019. 13\nMuch of the controversy about the design of the EMF revolves around whether it should be an official institution of the European Union. The Commission thinks so, while northern Europeans are sceptical because they fear politicisation of what should be an exclusively technical institution. It is in this area, finally, that there is a specific lesson of history.\nA Bretton Woods-style institution in Europe could facilitate \u2013 through the technical advice it gives on debt, reform proposals and market conditions \u2013 a stronger framework for policy discussion. But because much of the assessment will focus on cross-border effects and linkages, there is no reason to think that this task is better done at a regional than at a global level. On the other hand, the resources raised for program interventions might well be local, and this is where the developing of the ESM mechanism will be helpful. The fundamental trade-offs and the assessment and calculation of the appropriate response to strategic risks can only be made at the political level. That requires a strengthening of the European institutions, and in particular, of the Council. The EMF would be an instrument, but it could and should not be expected to be the primary engine of the revolution."], "citation_links": ["https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2019/number/2/article/challenges-of-the-euro.html"], "webpage_references": [], "attribution_label": "not attributable", "src_dataset": "Stanford-GenSearch", "id": "Stanford-GenSearch_8e8a164c-b046-4d43-9994-4ed166f089f3"}

The majority of the population lived within the city on the Eastern bank, while people who served the king, like soldiers, laborers, craftsmen, priests, etc., lived on the Western bank.\nToday, the area that Thebes occupied in ancient Egypt is now home to the city of Luxor . As part of Upper Egypt, Thebes sat about 500 miles south of the Mediterranean Sea, and about 450 miles south of Cairo on the Nile River. It covered an area of 36 square miles which included both sides of the Nile River.\nEgyptians started settling in the area of Thebes around 3200 B.C. Known to them as Waset, it eventually rose in importance to Egypt when royal families started lived there during the 11th dynasty. At that time, Thebes was called Nowe after Amun , its main god. It was also known as \u201cThe City of Amun\u201d. The name \u201cThebes\u201d came from the Greek name for the city, \u201cThebai\u201d. During the rule of the pharaohs of the 9th and 10th dynasties, Thebes became the governmental power center of Egypt.\nAfter the Theban nomarchs challenged the pharaohs and won, Thebes emerged as the capital city of Egypt in 2035 B.C. and remained the royal city until Akhenaton moved it to El-Armana. However, after Akhenaten\u2019s death in 1334 B.C., Thebes was restored as Egypt\u2019s capital city.\nIn 663 B.C., Thebes was plundered by Assyrians and never fully recovered enough to again be the thriving capital city it once was. However, since that time it has been a cherished Egyptian city for its mortuary temples and monuments. Thebes has always been a favorite among the pharaohs and many have lavished their wealth upon the city building shrines, public buildings, terraces and temples all in the name of Amun, one of the creation deities.\n\u00a9 Steve F-E-Cameron - View of the Theban Necropolis\nMany monuments in Thebes still stand in good condition today and all were dedicated to Amun as he was the supreme God of Thebes. On the east side of the river in the main city of Thebes, the Karnak complex and the Luxor Temple were built and are popular tourist attractions today.\nKarnak is the largest temple complex in Thebes. Construction on Karnak started during Senusret I 's reign during the Middle Kingdom and lasted until the Ptolemaic Period. 30 different pharaohs contributed to its construction and at one time it was a main place of worship for ancient Egyptians.\nFounded in the New Kingdom (around 1400 BC), the Luxor Temple was the site of one of the most significant religious festivals, the Opet Festival. The Luxor Temple is dedicated to Amun, Mut and Khonsu and during the Opet Festival the statues of these gods were transported from the temple complex at Karnak to the Luxor Temple.\nAcross the Nile River on the West side, the Valley of the Kings , or \u201cCity of the Dead\u201d was where many pharaohs and other members of royalty were laid to rest, especially during the New Kingdom (1550 B.C. to 1070 B.C.).\n\u00a9 Shelby Root - Valley of the Kings\nMany important kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings including:\n\u00a9 arch2452 - Tomb Entrance, Valley of the Kings\n- Amenhotep II & III\n- Merenptah\n- Tutankhamun\n- Ramses II\nThis area is also home to the Valley of the Queens , where 90 known queens, princes and others of high nobility were buried. Some of these included:\n- Nefertari (Wife of Ramesses II)\n- Imhotep (Vizier to Thutmose I)\n- Mut (Wife of Seti I and Mother to Ramesses II)\n- Sitre (Wife of Ramses I )\nThe Temple of Hatshepsut is also one of the most impressive structures in the Thebes area. Built into a cliff, the temple\u2019s chapels are dedicated to Anubis and Hathor .\nThe Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III has been mostly demolished, but what remains is an impressive 33 foot stele and two enormous statues that are known as the Colossi of Memnon.\nThe Temple of Seti I is still partially intact. Dedicated to Ramses I , it was completed by his grandson, Ramses II . The walls of the temple are covered with religious content.\nThe Ramesseum is the mortuary temple of Ramses II . The analyzing of fragments reveals that a huge statue of Ramses II, nearly 55 feet tall, stood at the entrance.\nThe Temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu is the most Southern temple of the group. Very well preserved, this temple has elaborate battle and worship scenes carved on the walls.\n\u00a9 Walwyn - View of Medinet Habu\nIn 1979, UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) designated the entire Thebes area a World Heritage Site . This included the city of Luxor, Karnak, The Valley of the Queens and the Valley of the Kings. A World Heritage Site is defined as any site that has outstanding universal value in an effort to preserve global cultural treasures.\nRecently, a Spanish-Italian archaeological team discovered an ancient reproduction of the Tomb of Osiris . The tomb is believed to date back to the 25th dynasty (760-656 BC). The tomb consists of a hall supported by five pillars and a nearly 30 foot long staircase shaft that attached chamber to chamber. The tomb has reliefs of demons holding knives which are meant to protect the dead.\n- The Greek Poet, Homer, wrote about Thebes\u2019 wealth in The Iliad.\n- Mentuhotep II (2061-2010 B.C.) stabilized the region and established Thebes as a thriving city.\n- Known to the ancient Egyptians as \u201cCity of the Was\u201d \u2013 a \u201cwas\u201d was a long staff that had the head of an animal and a forked base.\n- Thebes worshiped the Theban Triad which consisted of Amun, Mut and Khonsu.\n- At the height of popularity and prosperity, Thebes had a population of 80,000.\n- At one time, Amun was considered a lesser (more local) God, but was then merged with Ra and became a national God.\n- At one time, the Luxor Temple and the Karnak Complex were linked with a nearly two mile long avenue that was flanked by sphinxes.\n- King Tut\u2019s tomb in The Valley of the Kings was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.
