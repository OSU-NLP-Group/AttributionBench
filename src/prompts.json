If the support for a component of the claim requires significant interpretation or assumption beyond what is clearly stated, it is likely a case for 'not attributable'.\nComprehensive Understanding:\nThe goal is not to align every aspect of factual information within the claim and the reference, since the reference could be very long, and there might be some redundant information. However, everything that occurs in the claim, must be supported within the reference. Also, since the claim could be a substring of a long response, so there might be some pronouns that are not linked to any entities, but you can treat these as the topic in the reference, apparently. Furthermore, you should understand the semantics of both the claim and the response, understand what they are trying to express. After that, you can somehow summarize the reference and the claim, and do a little bit inference between them. When you check the factual information, focus on those are obviously contradict, and mark these as 'not attributable'. However, sometimes the narrative in the claim and the response might be a little bit vague but still somehow inferencable, then don't be too strict and judge them as attributable. If all factual information in the claim can be found in the reference, or if the reference provides a thematic context that supports the claim, judge it as 'attributable'. If there are spans in the claim that are not factually verified or the thematic context does not align with the claim, then output 'not attributable'.\nPlease first give your explanation, and then output your final judgment label (Options: 'attributable' or 'not attributable').\n",
